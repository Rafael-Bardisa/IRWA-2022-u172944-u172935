# Information-Retrieval--2022
UPF course 2022

This repository contains all the files regarding the practice sessions of the Information Retrieval course. Each delivery of the practice sessions will be linked to a folder with the name of the part at which we are referring to.

The first part of the project is in the folder named 'IRWA-2022-part-1' in which we can see the code of this first part of the project named 'Practice_1'. There is also the data needed for this first part (the json file with the tweets and the csv with the document ids map), and the code regarding the first practice session. 

To run the code, we need to open the practice_1 file in colab. We need to be sure that the files in the data folder have been uploaded to our own drive. Therefore we can run this file by executing all the cells.
