It is the sum of the relevance values of all results in a search result list (in the ranking). Suppose you were presented with a set of search results for a query and asked to rank each result:\n","- 0 => Not relevant \n","- 1 => Near relevant \n","- 2 => Relevant\n","\n","If we sum the values for a page of results we will have a measure of the cumulative gain (CG).\n","\n","$$CG = \\sum_{pos=1}^n Rel_{pos}\\tag{5}$$\n","\n","Where $Rel_{pos}$ is the graded relevance of $pos^{th}$ document.\n","\n","Cumulative gain, however, does not reward relevant results that appear higher in the result set (CG function is unaffected by changes in the ordering of search results). To achieve the Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) we must discount results that appear lower.\n","\n","**Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG):** The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.\n","\n","$$DCG = \\sum_{pos=1}^n \\frac{Rel_{pos}}{\\log_2(pos+1)} = Rel_1 + \\sum_{pos=2}^n \\frac{Rel_{pos}}{\\log_2(pos+1)}\\tag{6}$$\n","\n","An alternative formulation of $DCG$ that places stronger emphasis on retrieving relevant documents is the following:\n","\n","$$DCG = \\sum_{pos=1}^n \\frac{2^{Rel_{pos}} -1}{\\log_2(pos+1)}\\tag{7}$$\n","\n","The later formula is commonly used in industry including major web search companies. These two formulations of DCG are the same when the relevance values of documents are binary.\n","\n","**Normalized DCG (NDCG):** If you calculate DCG for different queries you’ll find that some queries are just harder than others and will produce lower DCG scores than easier queries. Normalization solves this problem by scaling the results based off of the best result seen. This is done by sorting all relevant documents in the corpus by their relative relevance, producing the maximum possible DCG through position $n$, also called **Ideal DCG (IDCG)** through that position (*usually it is the ground truth*).\n","\n","$$NDCG_{pos} = \\frac{DCG_{pos}}{iDCG}\\tag{8}$$\n","\n","<img src=\"images/ndcg.png\" style=\"width:650px;height:450px;\">\n","<caption><center> <u> <font color=''> Figure 2 </u><font color=''> : Computation of NDCG </br> \n","    (Picture taken from https://medium.com/swlh/rank-aware-recsys-evaluation-metrics-5191bba16832)</center></caption>  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lD5hxYgyroGi"},"source":["Implement the functions: \n","- ```dcg_at_k(y_score, doc_score, k)``` based on formula $7$  (approach that makes emphasis in retrieving relevant documents)\n","- ```ndcg_at_k(y_score, doc_score, k)``` Normalized DCG, which uses the ideal DCG\n","\n","Compute:\n","- the $NDCG@10$ for query with ```query_id=0```\n","- the average $NDCG@10$ (considering all queries/rankings)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZcuzmjN7roGi"},"source":["def dcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k=10): #doc_scire are the labels (ground truth) and y_score are the system scores\n","    order = np.argsort(y_score)[::-1]  # get the list of indexes of the predicted score sorted in descending order.\n","    doc_score = np.take(doc_score, order[:k])  # sort the actual relevance label of the documents based on predicted score(hint: np.take) and take first k.\n","    gain = 2 ** doc_score - 1  # First we calculate the upper part of the formula which is the CG (use formula 7 above) (notice it is based on the ground truth relevance)\n","    discounts = np.log2(np.arange(len(doc_score)) + 2)  # Compute denominator (np.arrange creates a list of numbers betweeen 0 and len(doc_score)-1), then the + 2 addresses the fact that the numbers start from 0\n","    return np.sum(gain / discounts)  #return dcg@k\n","\n","\n","def ndcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k=10):\n","    dcg_max = dcg_at_k(doc_score, doc_score, k) #ideal dcg\n","    #print(dcg_max)\n","    if not dcg_max:\n","        return 0\n","    return np.round(dcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k) / dcg_max, 4)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8-4-c0wZroGi"},"source":["##### the  𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺@10 for query with query_id=0"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_DxJLrcQroGi","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666264824048,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":253,"user":{"displayName":"DIANA RAMIREZ","userId":"04589314938991950248"}},"outputId":"d28f2419-4122-457e-e362-84350c8b436e"},"source":["query_id = 0\n","k = 10\n","labels = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == query_id][\"doc_score\"])\n","scores = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == query_id][\"predicted_relevance\"])\n","ndcg_k = np.round(ndcg_at_k(labels, scores, k), 4)\n","print(\"ndcg@{} for query with query_id={}: {}\".format(k, query_id, ndcg_k))\n","\n","\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ndcg@10 for query with query_id=0: 0.4392\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ou0rQNsUroGi"},"source":["##### the average  𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺@10  (considering all queries/rankings)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WSWwZjCFroGi","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666019605957,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2757,"user":{"displayName":"DIANA RAMIREZ","userId":"04589314938991950248"}},"outputId":"4b003a81-0284-4177-fe3a-16292ae2e353"},"source":["ndcgs = []\n","k = 10\n","for q in search_results['query_id'].unique(): # loop over all query ids\n","    labels = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == q][\"doc_score\"]) ## get labels for current query\n","    scores = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == q][\"predicted_relevance\"]) # get predicted score for current query\n","    ndcgs.append(np.round(ndcg_at_k(labels, scores, k), 4)) # append NDCG for current query (round is just about decimals)\n","\n","avg_ndcg = np.round(float(sum(ndcgs) / len(ndcgs)), 4)\n","print(\"Average ndcg@{}: {}\".format(k, avg_ndcg))\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Average ndcg@10: 0.4646\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LUcpJA6uroGi"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
