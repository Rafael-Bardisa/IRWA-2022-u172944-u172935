EPON is the necessity to provide adequate downstream and upstream bandwidth to support the   Multi Dwelling Unit MDU   environment  When deployed in the   Multi Dwelling Unit MDU   configuration  one EPON ONU may be connected to up to a thousand subscribers    The 10 10G EPON employs a number of functions that are common to other point to point Ethernet standards   For example  such functions as 64B 66B line coding  self synchronizing scrambler  or gearbox are also used in 10GBASE SR  10GBASE LR  10GBASE ER  10GBASE LRM  and 10GBASE KR types of Ethernet links       Asymmetric 10 Gb s EPON  10 1G EPON       The asymmetric 10 1G EPON appear less challenging than the symmetric option  as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies   The upstream transmission is identical to that of the existing 1G EPON  as specified in IEEE Std  802 3ah   and will rely on field proven and mass deployed burst mode optical transceivers  The downstream transmission  which uses continuous mode optics  will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit s point to point Ethernet devices       Power budgets     The 802 3av defines several power budgets  denoted either PR or PRX   PRX power budget describes asymmetric rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit s downstream and 1 Gbit s upstream   PR power budget describes symmetric rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit s downstream and 10 Gbit s upstream   Each power budget is further identified with a numeric representation of its class  where value of 10 represents low power budget  value of 20 represents medium power budget  and value of 30 represents high power budget   The 802 3av draft standard defines the following power budgets      class  wikitable  border  1       Power Budget   Downstream Line Rate  Gb s    Upstream Line Rate  Gb

on Reed Solomon 255  223   The FEC is mandatory for all channels operating at 10 Gbit s rate  i e   both downstream and upstream channels in symmetric 10 Gbit s EPON and the downstream channel in the 10 1 Gbit s asymmetric EPON   Upstream channel in the asymmetric EPON is the same as in 1 Gbit s EPON  i e   optional frame based FEC using RS 255  239        Backward compatibility     The 10G EPON standard defines a new physical layer  keeping the MAC  MAC Control and all the layers above unchanged to the greatest extent possible   This means that users of 10G EPON can expect backward compatibility of network management system  NMS   PON layer operations  administrations  and maintenance  OAM  system  DBA and scheduling  and so on       Coexistence with 1G EPON      The 802 3av standard places significant emphasis on enabling simultaneous operation of 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s EPON systems on the same outside plant  In the downstream direction  the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s channels are separated in the wavelength domain  with 1 Gbit s transmission limited to 1480 1500 nm band and 10 Gbit s transmission using 1575 1580 nm band    In the upstream direction  the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s bands overlap  1 Gbit s band spreads from 1260 to   convert 1360 nmi km abbr on    10 Gbit s band uses 1260 to   convert 1280 nmi km abbr on   band   This allows both upstream channels to share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic disperson  but requires the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s channels to be separated in time domain  Since burst transmissions from different ONUs now may have different line rates  this method is termed   dual rate TDMA     Various OLT implementations may support 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s transmissions only downstream direction  only upstream direction  or in both downstream and upstream directions  The following table illustrates which ONU types are simultaneously supported by various OLT implementations      class  wikitable  border  1

53|2 XL|  for the Estonian band formerly known as 2XL Soul Militia      2 XL    was an educational toy in the shape of a   robot   that was introduced in   1978    2 XL was the  brainchild of  Dr    Michael J  Freeman    who felt that toys should be both fun and educational  The toy was interactive  playing various tracks from a magnetic audio tape depending on the user s actions   The toy was released in two different time periods  The 1978 release was produced by a toy company called   Mego Corporation    and used   Stereo 8 8 track   tapes  It was brought back in   1992   by   Tiger Electronics   in a version that used   Compact audio cassette cassette tapes   rather than 8 Track     Mego Corporation version      Description      Image 2 XL jpg thumb right 250px Mego Corporation s 2 XL circa 1978   The original 2 XL  see image to right  was made of hard brown plastic  with white plastic on the front    The toy had two yellow light bulbs for eyes that flashed at various moments while the 8 track program tapes played  and he had four red push buttons on his stomach    Question     A or Yes Or True    B or More Info     C or No or False   There was also a volume and power on knob found on the lower right portion of the unit  At the bottom was a large slot where an 8 Track tape would be inserted   The toy was essentially a regular 8 Track player  with each button operating a different track   It was powered by a common 9 volt AC adapter with a 3 5 mm mini plug tip       Development    Michael J  Freeman had a hard time convincing companies of the benefits that his toy would provide  Many companies turned down the idea  saying it was just too expensive and not practical to invest so much into an educational toy when kids are typically reluctant to buy educational items  Finally  Mego Corporation decided that it fit in well with their company  They were makers of action figures based on popular TV shows  many of which were   sci fi   related    Freeman was involved with all phases of the toy s development  including how the internal mechanism worked  The Mego version of 2 XL was produced for four years  1978 1981     The mold and look got a minor change in   1980     The eye lights became red  The louder the volume was turned  the brighter the lights would flash  The speaker in the back of the unit was changed from a hexagon shape to a more traditional round speaker shape    The plastic was shiner and glossier looking  All told there were about 50 program tapes made for the Mego 2 XL   It was highly popular in its first years  but it faded into obscurity after the turn of the decade  The toy will often show up on auction sites and in used toy stores  They aren t rare by any means  but aren t in mass quantities either  Some of the tapes can be harder to find  the last year tapes are rarer due to the decreased popularity of the toy in its last year on the market      Programs    The 8 Track tapes focused around a robot with a   New York   accent   voiced by creator Dr  Michael J  Freeman Ph D  himself  who would speak as if the listener was right there with him wherever he happened to be in the storyline  He would ask multiple choice questions based on the subject of the tape  and the user would answer the question he asked by pushing the corresponding button   A right answer resulted in 2 XL congratulating the user on his knowledge  while a wrong answer would result in a razzing as 2 XL explained what the proper answer was  In between questions  there would sometimes be a story going on that the user was involved with  with the answers to the questions corresponding to the storyline  Other times 2 XL would crack a bad joke and laugh at his own humor with a crazy sounding laugh that was one of the many running gags that would be found on almost every tape in the series   Originally the programs were very basic  There was just one general story line   Each track flowed through the same time length  differing only by telling the user if he was right or wrong   Eventually  Dr  Freeman started to take advantage of the four tracks found on a tape to have up to three different programs on one tape    There were some general themes to each tape  The first was 2 XL s bleeping and buzzing sound effects as it turned on  as if the user was activating a huge robot  although he would often refer to its size as only a foot or so tall   He would always introduce himself in the same way  saying   Thank you for turning me on  I am 2 XL       The voice did not sound robotic  and was pretty much Michael s voice only a bit slower speaking and more sophisticated sounding  There would always be a moment where the user had to push the Question button  as that went back to track one  which is where the main talking took place  There was always music or beeping sounds while the user would think  or while the new questions were loading  to make the program space out properly  Towards the end of the tape 2 XL would give the user a warning that he was getting tired and that it was time to wrap things up with one last question   He was always very friendly and acted very human  as if he was a new buddy that wanted to help the user learn in the most enjoyable way possible   His humor was silly as were his wisecracks  but the same themes were found throughout the various tapes  getting more and more creative as the future tapes were introduced  He would often say  Please turn me off now  and often relate the reason he had to go somehow to the topic of the tape         Deleted image removed    Image 2 XLtapes JPG thumb right 250px Eight of Mego Corporation s 2 XL 8 Track Tapes       2 XL came with one tape  titled  General Information   which touched on various topics such as sports  movies  and pop culture  Each of the various other program tapes was sold separately and most came with a separate activity book that could be used as well while doing the activity with 2 XL  Some also came with faceplate cards that could be placed over the various buttons that had different words on them that were specifically to be used for that certain program tape  Not all of the tapes were educational  some told stories that the user would just listen to able to answer a few questions about them afterwards  Not all tapes were focused around 2 XL either  Other voices would appear on them depending on what the focus of each tape was  But somewhere 2 XL s voice would show up to keep everything in the same universe  There were also two tape sets that would continue on with the theme of the first tape after the user finished it     Tiger Electronics version     Image 2 xltiger JPG thumb right 250px Tiger Electronic s version of 2 XL along with some program cassette tapes circa 1992    In 1992  Tiger Electronics re introduced 2 XL  Instead of 8 track tapes  the new version used cassette tapes that were twice the length of the 8 tracks and had better sound quality  Freeman again provided the toy s voice  In addition to eyes that would light up  the toy now sported a circle for a mouth that could light up as he talked  The toy could now run on batteries and had a headphone jack   Instead of the buttons simply switching tracks on the 8 track tape as in the old version  the cassette version took advantage of the fact that a cassette has a total of four tracks   one for the left and right channel on each side  The tape head in the player could play any of the four parallel tracks  based on which button was pressed  Playing a 2 XL tape in a standard tape player would result in different audio on the left and right channels  and if the reverse side was played  which was typically marked with the words  Wrong Side    one would hear the other two tracks played in reverse   As with the previous version  the cassette version could play any standard cassette tape  but the user needed to first push the  Question  button  or the  2 A No  button would work as well  playing the right channel   Pressing the 3 or 4 button would play one of the channels on the reverse side of the tape backwards     Image 2 XLx men casette jpg thumb right 125px Tiger Electronic s X Men Cassette Adventure tape for the 2 XL toy    Newly released tapes were branded with comic book and cartoon characters  including   Spider Man      Star Trek  The Next Generation      Mighty Morphin Power Rangers      X Men   and   Batman    2 XL games would allow the user to go on an adventure with various superheroes  deciding their fate by pushing one of the buttons   The second version was on the market from 1992 through 1994  and about 45 tapes were released in total  The final inventory was sold in 1995 bundled with the Power Rangers tape  It was one of the most popular toys  in terms or market revenue  sold up through 1995    This version of 2 XL got even more exposure due to it being used on a kids TV Game Show at the time named    Pick Your Brain     A 10 foot replica of the Tiger Electronics 2 XL was used on the set to ask questions and offer extra information on the topic being talked about  Freeman was asked to do the voice of 2 XL but declined  The show was hosted by   Marc Summers   and 2 XL on this show was voiced by   Greg Berg    This show had a high success in its first year  but was ended when the production of 2 XL ceased     Tri Lex    One of the last tapes released for the Mego Corporation version of 2XL was  Tri Lex   a complete board game designed to be played by 2XL   The tape came with a board which fitted over the front of the 2XL unit itself  with the board in front of the tape slot   The game board consisted of an inverted pyramid shape  4 squares wide at the top to 1 square at the bottom  with each row coloured in a different colour  Blue  Yellow  Green  and Tan   and 4 slots through which pieces  which 2XL called  checkers   could be dropped into the pyramid   The slots aligned with 2XL s 4 buttons  with the intention that dropping the checker would also press the appropriate track button on 2XL   The objective of the game was to create either a line or a triangle of 3 checkers of your own colour   The game and tape design are interesting because they enabled the 4 track tape player to provide a passable simulation of a game playing AI   Several  tricks  had to be used  an additional set of  front  slots that did not interact with the buttons were provided  and 2XL occasionally told the player to  make a move in the front  so that the track would not change   2XL would also ask the player to  remember a codeword  at certain points in the game  and to repeat it back later   Often the game would end before the tape did  meaning that 2XL would prompt the player with  please turn my volume down to zero   after which the player would have to wait for the remainder of the current game s recording to wind through before a track changing  click  signalled they should turn the volume back up    For this reason  Tri lex was the only 2XL tape that did not say  thank you for turning me on  at the start  since the player was expected to play several games in a single session    Finally  although the tape appears to loop after one game  it in fact has four games recorded on it     The game itself is easily solved  and correctly played always ends in a win for the starting player   The tape was thus more valuable for teaching pattern recognition than as a genuine board game   On the tape  the player can in fact beat 2XL  but only on two of the recorded games  those where the human player goes first    The player can defeat 2XL by using the guaranteed win  or   on occasion   by using other strategies where 2XL  makes a mistake    2XL does not use the guaranteed win strategy against human players     The guaranteed win is as follows  first player plays Tan  forced  only space available   second player plays Green 1 2  forced  only spaces available   which one does not matter  as the ensuing positions are mirror images of each other  continue following the moves on the appropriate side of the     first player plays Green 2 1  second player plays Yellow 3 1  forced  else first player plays it and wins with a line   first player plays Yellow 2  second player plays Blue  3 or 4   1 or 2   first player plays Blue  4 or 3   2 or 1   forced  else second player plays it and wins with a triangle   second player plays Yellow 1 3  forced  only space available   first player plays Blue 2 3 and wins with a line of three     Similar Toys      Kasey the Kinderbot    Kasey the Kinderbot was a toy designed by Dr  Freeman which was targeted at kids aged 3 7   Instead of tapes as with the previous versions  this toy used small cartridges that were not linear   the user was able to jump around to various sections at will  It was purely an educational toy with cartridges focusing on such subjects as Math  Science and languages  The cartridges were also color coded to let kids know what group of subject it belonged to  The toy was first released in 2002 by   Fisher Price    It produced a total profit of over  70 million  Spin off characters included   Toby the Totbot    which

75|26 bit|  N bit 26     In the   ARM Limited ARM     ARM architecture processor architecture       26 bit    refers to the design used in the original ARM processors  where the   Program Counter       PC     and   Status register Processor Status Register       PSR     were combined into one 32 bit   Processor registers register    R15   the status flags filling the high 6 bits and the Program Counter taking up the lower 26 bits   In fact  because the program counter is always word aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the designers to reuse these two bits to hold the processor s mode bits too  The four modes allowed were USR26  SVC26  IRQ26  FIQ26  contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent   ARM Architecture ARM architectures     This design enabled more efficient   Computer program program   execution  as the Program Counter and status flags could be saved and restored with a single operation  This resulted in faster   subroutine   calls and   interrupt   response than traditional designs  which would have to do two register loads or saves when calling or returning from a subroutine     History    Despite being   32 bit   internally  processors prior to the ARM6 had only a 26 bit PC and   address bus    and were consequently limited to 64 MB of addressable   Random Access Memory memory    This was still a vast amount of memory at the time  but because of this limitation  architectures since have included various steps away from the original 26 bit design   The ARM6 introduced a 32 bit PC and separate PSR  as well as a 32 bit address bus  allowing 4 GB of memory to be addressed  The change in the PC PSR layout caused incompatibility with code written for previous architectures  so the processor also included a 26 bit compatibility mode which used the old PC PSR combination  The processor could still address 4 GB in this mode  but could not   Execution  computers  execute   anything above address 3FFFFFC  64 MB   This mode was used by   RISC OS   running on the   Risc PC Acorn Risc PC   to utilise the new processors while retaining compatibility with existing software   More recent ARM architectures such as   Intel   s   XScale   have dropped the 26 bit mode altogether     External links     http   web archive org web 20070809230809 http   www arm com pdfs Apps11vC html Differences Between ARM6 and Earlier ARM Processors    http   www iyonix com 32bit download 32bit dev pdf  Using the Acorn C C   Development Environment to write 32 bit RISC OS software     Details on the architectural changes and converting code between 26 bit and 32 bit    http   www heyrick co uk assembler 32bit html   Information on converting assembler to 32 bit    Category ARM architecture

configuration and   Loadable kernel module modular kernel   design      History     386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni   Lynne Jolitz   and   William Jolitz    William Jolitz had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California at Berkeley  2 8 and 2 9BSD  and both contributed code to Berkeley developed at   Symmetric Computer Systems   during the 1980s  Work on porting 4 3BSD Reno and later 4 3BSD Net 2 to the Intel 80386 was done for the University of California by William Jolitz at Berkeley  4 3BSD Net 2 was an incomplete non operational release  with portions withheld by the University of California as   encumbered    i e  subject to an   AT T UNIX     source code   license   The 386BSD releases made to the public beginning in 1992 were based on portions of the 4 3BSD Net 2 release coupled with additional code  see   Missing Pieces I and II      Dr  Dobb s Journal    May June 1992  written by William and Lynne Jolitz to make a complete operational release   The port began in 1989 and the first  incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4 3BSD Net 2 of 1991  It was first released in March 1992  version 0 0  and in a much more usable version on July 14  1992  version 0 1   The porting process with code was extensively documented in an 18 part series written by Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz in   Dr  Dobbs Journal   beginning in January 1991      FreeBSD and NetBSD    After the release of 386BSD 0 1  a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements  releasing them as an unofficial     patch  computing  patchkit      Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD  the maintainers of the patchkit founded the   FreeBSD   project in 1993 to continue their work ref  http   www freebsd org doc en US ISO8859 1 books handbook history html About the FreeBSD Project     Bot generated title       ref   Around the same time  the   NetBSD   project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users  with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi platform system  Both projects continue to this day      Lawsuit    Due to a lawsuit    Unix System Laboratories USL   v  Regents of the University of California   some potentially so called   encumbered   source was agreed to have been distributed within the   Berkeley Software Distribution   from the University of California  and a subsequent release  1993  4 4BSD Lite  was made by the University to correct this issue  However  386BSD  Dr  Dobbs Journal  and William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California  and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before  during  and after these lawsuits without limitation  There has never been any legal filings or claims from the University  USL  or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD  Finally  no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits     Release 1 0   In late 1994  a finished version 386BSD Release 1 0 was distributed by Dr  Dobb s Journal on CDROM only due to the immense size  600   megabyte MB    of the release  the    386BSD Reference CD ROM     and was a best selling CDROM for three years  1994 1997   386BSD Release 1 0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation  and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD     Relationship with BSD 386   386BSD is often confused with   BSD 386   which was developed by   Berkeley Software Design BSDi    a Berkeley spinout  starting in 1991  BSD 386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on   4 3BSD NET 2    Although Jolitz worked briefly for   UUNET    which later spun out BSDi  in 1991  the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD  Instead  William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing  and returned all materials when William Jolitz left that company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals     Copyright and use of the code   All rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz  386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now

covers only some of the software used     Uses   3D modelers are used in a wide variety of industries   The medical industry uses them to create detailed models of organs   The movie industry uses them to create and manipulate characters and objects for animated and real life   film motion pictures     The   video game industry   uses them to create assets for   video game  s  The science sector uses them to create highly detailed models of chemical compounds   The architecture industry uses them to create models of proposed buildings and landscapes   The engineering community uses them to design new devices  vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses  There are typically many stages in the    Pipeline  computing  pipeline    that studios and manufacturers use to create 3D objects for film  games  and production of hard goods and structures     Features   Many 3D modelers are designed to model various real world entities  from   plant  s to   automobile  s to   human people     Some are specially designed to model certain objects  such as chemical compounds or internal   organ  anatomy  organ  s   3D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their 3D mesh   Users can add  subtract  stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire   Models can be viewed from a variety of angles  usually simultaneously   Models can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out   3D modelers can export their models to   computer file files    which can then be imported into other applications as long as the   metadata   is compatible   Many modelers allow   importer  computing  importers   and   exporter  computing  exporters   to be   plugin plugged in    so they can read and write data in the native formats of other applications   Most 3D modelers contain a number of related features  such as   Ray tracing  graphics  ray tracers   and other rendering alternatives and   texture mapping   facilities   Some also contain features that support or allow animation of models   Some may be able to generate   full motion video   of a series of rendered scenes  i e    animation        Commercial packages   A basic comparison including

139|3D single object recognition|  FeatureDetectionCompVisNavbox    In   computer vision       3D single   object recognition      involves recognizing and determining the pose of user chosen   Three dimensional space 3D   object in a   photograph   or   range scan     Typically  an example of the object to be recognized is presented to a vision system in a controlled environment  and then for an arbitrary input such as a   video stream    the system locates the previously presented object   This can be done either   off line    or in   real time     The   algorithms   for solving this problem are specialized for locating a single pre identified object  and can be contrasted with algorithms which operate on general   class  computer science  classes   of objects  such as   Facial recognition system face recognition systems   or   3D generic object recognition     Due to the low cost and ease of acquiring photographs  a significant amount of research has been devoted to 3D object recognition in photographs      3D single object recognition in photographs     The method of recognizing a 3D object depends on the properties of an object   For simplicity  many existing algorithms have focused on recognizing   Stiffness rigid   objects consisting of a single part  that is  objects whose spatial transformation is a   Euclidean motion     Two general approaches have been taken to the problem    pattern recognition   approaches use low level image appearance information to locate an object  while feature based geometric approaches construct a model for the object to be recognized  and match the model against the photograph         Pattern recognition approaches      These methods use appearance information gathered from pre captured or pre computed projections of an object to match the object in the potentially cluttered scene   However  they do not take the 3D geometric constraints of the object into consideration during matching  and typically also do not handle occlusion as well as feature based approaches   See  Murase and Nayar 1995  and  Selinger and Nelson 1999        Feature based geometric approaches        Image Feature example png right thumb 322px An example of a detected feature in an image   Blue indicates the center of the feature  the red ellipse indicates the characteristic scale identified by the feature detector  and the green parallelogram is constructed from the coordinates of the ellipse as per  Lowe 2004      Feature based approaches work well for objects which have distinctive   Feature  Computer vision  features     Thus far  objects which have good   edge feature  s or   Blob detection blob   features have been successfully recognized  for example detection algorithms  see   Harris affine region detector   and   Scale invariant feature transform SIFT    respectively   Due to lack of the appropriate feature detectors  objects without textured  smooth surfaces cannot currently be handled by this approach   Feature based object recognizers generally work by pre capturing a number of fixed views of the object to be recognized  extracting features from these views  and then in the recognition process  matching these features to the scene and enforcing geometric constraints   As an example of a prototypical system taking this approach  we will present an outline of the method used by  Rothganger et al  2004   with some detail elided   The method starts by assuming that objects undergo globally rigid transformations   Because smooth surfaces are locally planar    affine invariant   features are appropriate for matching  the paper   feature detector detects   ellipse shaped regions of interest using both edge like and blob like features  and as per  Lowe 2004   finds the dominant gradient direction of the ellipse  converts the ellipse into a parallelogram  and takes a   SIFT   descriptor on the resulting parallelogram   Color information is used also to improve discrimination over SIFT features alone     Image Partial features 3d png right thumb 322px Partial models of features  projected into 3D  constructed from nearby views of a teddy bear   Taken from  Rothganger et al  2004      Next  given a number of camera views of the object  24 in the paper   the method constructs a 3D model for the object  containing the 3D spatial position and orientation of each feature   Because the number of views of the object is large  typically each feature is present in several adjacent views   The center points of such matching features correspond  and detected features are aligned along the dominant gradient direction  so the points at  1  0  in the local coordinate system of the feature parallelogram also correspond  as do the points  0  1  in the parallelogram s local coordinates   Thus for every pair of matching features in nearby views  three point pair correspondences are known   Given at least two matching features  a multi view affine   structure from motion   algorithm  see  Tomasi and Kanade 1992   can be used to construct an estimate of points positions  up to an arbitrary affine transformation    The paper of Rothganger et al  therefore selects two adjacent views  uses a   RANSAC   like method to select two corresponding pairs of features  and adds new features to the partial model built by RANSAC so long as they are under an error term   Thus for any given pair of adjacent views  the algorithm creates a partial model of all features visible in both views     Image Features full 3d png right thumb 322px Final merged model of features for the teddy bear  after Euclidean upgrade   For recognition  this model is matched against a photograph of the scene using RANSAC   Taken from  Rothganger et al  2004      To produce a unified model  the paper takes the largest partial model  and incrementally aligns all smaller partial models to it   Global minimization is used to reduce the error  then a   Euclidean upgrade   is used to change the model s feature positions from 3D coordinates unique up to affine transformation to 3D coordinates that are unique up to   Euclidean motion     At the end of this step  one has a model of the target object  consisting of features projected into a common 3D space   To recognize an object in an arbitrary input image  the paper detects features  and then uses   RANSAC   to find the   affine projection   matrix which best fits the unified object model to the 2D scene   If this RANSAC approach has sufficiently low error  then on success  the algorithm both recognizes the object and gives the object s pose in terms of an affine projection   Under the assumed conditions  the method typically achieves recognition rates of around 95       References       Murase  H  and S  K  Nayar  1995    Visual

183|64 bit|  Refimprove date May 2009     N bit 64  8   octet  computing  octets          64 bit    CPUs have existed in   supercomputers   since the 1970s    Cray 1    1975    CDC 6000 series    1964  were 60 bit  and in   RISC   based   computer workstation workstations   and   Server  computing  server  s since the early 1990s  In 2003 they were introduced to the  previously   32 bit    mainstream   personal computer   arena  in the form of the   x86 64   and 64 bit   PowerPC   processor architectures   Without further qualification  a   64 bit   computer architecture generally has integer and addressing   processor register registers   that are 64 bits wide  allowing direct support for 64 bit data types and addresses  However  a CPU might have external   data bus  es or   address bus  es with different sizes from the registers  even larger  the 32 bit   Pentium  brand  Pentium   had a 64 bit data bus  for instance   The term may also refer to the size of low level data types  such as 64 bit   Floating point floating point   numbers     Architectural implications   Processor registers are typically divided into several groups    integer      floating point        SIMD        control    and often special registers for address arithmetic which may have various uses and names such as   address      index   or   base registers    However  in modern designs  these functions are often performed by more general purpose   integer   registers  In most processors  only integer and or address registers can be used to address data in memory  the other types cannot  The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory  even if there are registers  such as floating point registers  that are wider   Most high performance 32 bit and 64 bit processors  some notable exceptions are most   ARM architecture ARM   and 32 bit   MIPS architecture MIPS   CPUs  have integrated floating point hardware  which is often  but not always  based on 64 bit units of data  For example  although the   x86     x87   architecture has instructions capable of loading and storing 64 bit  and 32 bit  floating point values in memory  the internal data and register format is 80 bits wide  In contrast  the 64 bit   DEC Alpha Alpha   family uses a 64 bit floating point data and register format  as well as 64 bit integer registers      History   Most CPUs are designed so that the contents of a single integer register can store the   memory address address    location  of any datum in the computer s   virtual memory    Therefore  the total number of addresses in the virtual memory  mdash  the total amount of data the computer can keep in its working area  mdash  is determined by the width of these registers  Beginning in the 1960s with the   IBM     System 360    which was an exception  in that it used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses  resulting in a 16   megabyte MB      nowrap 16   1024 sup 2  sup  bytes    address space size   then  amongst many others  the   Digital Equipment Corporation DEC     VAX   minicomputer in the 1970s  and then with the   Intel 80386   in the mid 1980s  a   de facto   consensus developed that 32 bits was a convenient register size   A 32 bit   address register   meant that 2 sup 32  sup  addresses  or 4   Gigabyte GB   of   Random Access Memory RAM    could be referenced  At the time these architectures were devised  4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical quantities  4 MB  in installations that this was considered to be enough  headroom  for addressing  4 29 billion addresses were considered an appropriate size to work with for another important reason  4 29 billion integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in applications like   database  s   Some   supercomputer   architectures of the 1970s and 1980s used registers up to 64 bits wide  In the mid 1980s  Intel i860 ref   cite journal  url http   www

and 64 bit processors  Applications such as multi tasking  stress testing  and clustering for HPC    high performance computing    may be more suited to a 64 bit architecture when deployed appropriately  64 bit clusters have been widely deployed in large organizations such as IBM  HP and Microsoft  for this reason     Pros and cons   A common  fact date January 2011   misconception is that 64 bit architectures are no better than 32 bit architectures unless the computer has more than 4 GB of   main memory    This is not entirely true    Some operating systems and certain hardware configurations limit the physical memory space to 3 GB on   IA 32   systems  due to much of the 3 4 GB region being reserved for hardware addressing  see   3 GB barrier    This is not present in 64 bit architectures  which can use 4 GB of memory and more  However  IA 32 processors from the   Pentium II   onwards allow for a 36 bit   physical   memory address space  using   Physical Address Extension    PAE   which gives a 64 GB physical address range  of which up to 62 GB may be used by main memory  operating systems that support PAE may not be limited to 4GB of physical memory  even on IA 32 processors    Some operating systems reserve portions of   Process  computing  process     address space   for OS use  effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs  For instance  Windows XP DLLs and other user mode OS components are mapped into each process s address space  leaving only 2 to 3 GB  depending on the settings  address space available  This limit is currently much higher on 64 bit operating systems and does not realistically restrict memory usage      Memory mapped file  s are becoming more difficult to implement in 32 bit architectures   Citation needed date November 2010   A 4 GB file is no longer uncommon  and such large files cannot be memory mapped easily to 32 bit architectures  only a region of the file can be mapped into the address space  and to access such a file by memory mapping  those regions will have to be mapped into and out of the address space as needed  This is a problem  as memory mapping remains one of the most efficient disk to memory methods  when properly implemented by the OS    Some programs such as data encryption software can benefit greatly from 64 bit registers  if the software is 64 bit compiled  and effectively execute 3 to 5 times faster on 64 bit than on 32 bit   Citation needed date April 2010     Some 64 bit architectures  such as   x86 64    allow for more general purpose registers than their 32 bit counterparts  This is a significant speed increase for tight loops since the processor doesn t have to go out the second level cache or main memory to gather data if it can fit in the available registers   Example in   C  programming language  C     source lang  c   for  a 0  a 100  a        b   a    c   b    d   c    e   d      source   If a processor only has the ability to keep two three values variables  registers  in fast memory it would need to stop executing and push and pop the stack to be able to process variable d and e as well  A process that takes a lot of CPU cycles  A processor that is capable of holding all the values variables  registers  in memory can simply just loop through this without needing to halt execution for each iteration just to get the proper data in memory  This behavior can easily be compared with virtual memory  although any effects are contingent upon the compiler   The main disadvantage of 64 bit architectures is that relative to 32 bit architectures  the same data occupies more space in memory  due to swollen pointers and possibly other types and alignment padding   This increases the memory requirements of a given process and can have implications for efficient processor cache utilization  Maintaining a partial 32 bit model is one way to handle this and is in general reasonably effective  For example  the   z OS   operating system takes this approach currently  requiring program code to reside in 31 bit address spaces  the high order bit is not used in address calculation on the underlying hardware platform  while data objects can optionally reside in 64 bit regions   Currently  most proprietary   x86   software is compiled into 32 bit code  with less being also compiled into 64 bit code  although the trend is rapidly equalizing   Citation needed date July 2010     so much does not take advantage of the larger 64 bit address space or wider 64 bit registers and data paths on x86 processors  or the additional registers in 64 bit mode  However  users of most RISC platforms  and users of   free software free   or   open source   operating systems  where the   source code   is available for recompiling with a 64 bit compiler  have been able to use exclusive 64 bit computing environments for years due to the likelihood of the existence of someone willing to compile the code thusly  Not all such applications require a large address space nor manipulate 64 bit data items  so they wouldn t benefit from the larger address space or wider registers and data paths  The main advantage to 64 bit versions of such applications is the ability to access more registers in the   x86 64   architecture       Software availability     x86 based 64 bit systems sometimes lack equivalents to   software   that is written for 32 bit architectures  The most severe problem in Microsoft Windows is incompatible   device driver  s  Most 32 bit application software can run on a 64

devices were not available until early 2007  Vista x64   using 64 bit Microsoft Windows operating system was considered a challenge  However  the trend is changing towards 64 bit computing as most manufacturers provide both 32 bit and 64 bit drivers nowadays  so this issue is most likely to occur when attempting to use older peripherals   This is less of a problem with open source drivers that are already available for a 32 bit OS  since they can be modified to be 64 bit compatible  if necessary  Furthermore  support for hardware made before early 2007 was equally troubling for opensource platforms due to their small market shares in desktop market   On most Macs    Mac OS X   runs with a 32 bit kernel even on 64 bit capable processors  but the 32 bit kernel can run 64 bit user mode

with 64 bit processors  both the 32 bit and 64 bit Mac OS X kernel can run 32 bit user mode code  and all versions of Mac OS X include 32 bit versions of libraries that 32 bit applications would use

These are described as having an    LP64      data model    Another alternative is the    ILP64    data model in which all three data types are 64 bits wide  and even    SILP64    where  short  integers are also 64 bits wide  Citation needed date February 2007    However  in most cases the modifications required are relatively minor and straightforward  and many well written programs can simply be recompiled for the new environment without changes  Another alternative is the    LLP64    model  which maintains compatibility with 32 bit code by leaving both int and long as 32 bit   LL

   and IBM   z OS   native compilers   Microsoft s   Visual C     compiler uses the    LLP64    model  The disadvantage of the LP64 model is that storing a long into an int may overflow  On the other hand  casting a pointer to a long will work  In the LLP model  the reverse is true  These are not problems which affect fully standard compliant code but code is often written with implicit assumptions about the widths of integer types   Note that a programming model is a choice made on a per compiler basis  and several can coexist on the same OS  However  the programming model chosen as the primary model for the OS API typically dominates   Another consideration is the data model used for   Device driver driver  s  Drivers make up the majority of the operating system code in most modern operating systems  although many may not be loaded when the operating system is running   Many drivers use pointers heavily to manipulate data  and in some cases have to load pointers of a certain size into the hardware they support for   Direct memory access DMA    As an example  a driver for a 32 bit PCI device asking the device to DMA data into upper areas of a 64 bit machine s memory could not satisfy requests from the operating system to load data from the device to memory above the 4 gigabyte barrier  because the pointers for those addresses would not fit into the DMA

203|8A4 class ROUV|  Technical date September 2009   The    8A4 class ROUV    is a   remotely operated underwater vehicle    ROUV   a Chinese ROUV used to perform various underwater tasks ranging from oil platform service to salvage and rescue missions  The 8A4 is a member of a series of related ROUVs developed in the   People s Republic of China    with improved versions designed using earlier versions or commercially available versions as a starting point  The predecessor to the 8A4 is the RECON IV  which is an improved version of the American RECON III  The 8A4 is an improved version of the American AMETEK 2006  The 7B8 is an improved version of the 8A4  ref  http   www shtong gov cn node2 node2245 node76988 node76993 node77007 node77103 userobject1ai96372 html 8A4 ROUV  in Chinese    ref     RECON IV ROUV   The origin of 8A4 traces back to the RECON IV ROUV   Since the 1980s  China begun to operate ROUVs to support its offshore oil drill operations and salvage operations  such as Hysub 10 ROUVs and Hysub 40 ROUVs supplied by the Canadian firm International Submarine Engineering in   British Columbia     Hysub 40 ROUVs was deployed by   Shanghai   Salvage Bureau and proved its worth not only in oil drilling operations  but also in salvage and rescue missions   However  these foreign built ROUVs were simply too expensive to be adopted in significant numbers  and the salvage operational needs of the   People s Liberation Army Navy    PLAN  could not be met   As a result  China decided to develop its own version of ROUVs with similar capability   One of the first ROUVs domestically built in China was the RECON IV ROUV  which is based on the American RECON III ROUV built by Perry Oceanographic  later purchased by   Lockheed Martin    based in   Riviera Beach  Florida     Based on the technology transfer  the   Shenyang Institute of Automation   of the   Chinese Academy of Science   and Perry Oceanographic jointly developed the RECON IV ROUV  which was adopted by People s Liberation Army Navy for salvage and rescue operations   However  like earlier ROUVs  the RECON IV is primarily designed for civilian operations and had its limitations in performing certain military operations  such as cutting through specialized steel used to build certain compartments of submarines that were stranded  and opening some valves on sinking vessels  thus a more capable follow up was needed     8A4 ROUV   To develop a ROUV that meets the special needs of military salvage and rescue operations that was not commercially available on the market  China organized a design team in the late 1980s including the 702nd Research Institute of   China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation    CSIC   the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of   Harbin Engineering University    HEU   and the Institute of Underwater Engineering of   Shanghai Jiao Tong University    SHJTU   with a professor of SHJTU  Mr  Xu Huangnan        and the future deputy general designer of   Explorer AUV    and the future general designer of other Chinese unmanned underwater vehicles including   Sea Dragon class ROUV      CR class AUV    and   SJT class ROUV    was named as the general designer of the 8A4 ROUV   The goal was to develop an ROUV primarily used for military applications  while also capable of performing civilian tasks as the secondary mission   To shorten the time needed  the decision was made to develop an ROUV based on existing technology by first selecting a system available on the market with performance closest to the requirements  and then improving the commercially available system based on the experienced gained from the RECON IV ROUV developed earlier  The AMETEK 2006  an American ROUV used to support offshore oil drilling operations  was selected because it was the one that met the requirements best  while also being the one China could purchase on the international market at the time   However  despite meeting Chinese requirements better than all of the rest available systems  it was far from getting close  so extensive improvements were needed   One of the major upgrades needed was the complete redesign and incorporation of two manipulators that were required to operate around half a dozen tools underwater  ref  http   ch hust edu cn xsky news asp id 91 Manipulators of the 8A4 ROUV  in Chinese    ref   These manipulators were completed by the main subcontractor  the   Huazhong University of Science and Technology    HUST   and eventually won 1st Place in the Scientific and Technological Advancement Award of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation in 1996   The first 8A4 ROUV completed sea trials in 1993 and subsequently entered service   During its evaluation  the 8A4 ROUV successfully opened a submarine compartment constructed of special steel  a feat no other ROUV in Chinese inventory could achieve  and the 8A4 was thus dubbed as the most capable salvage and rescue ROUV in Chinese service  The 8A4 is capable of operating at a depth of up to 600 meters  with a cruising radius of up to 150 meters  and it was one of the first ROUVs in Chinese inventory to incorporate a Tether Management System  TMS    In 1996  the 8A4 ROUV won 3rd Place in the Scientific and Technological Advancement Award of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation   Despite the success and awards received  the 8A4 class ROUV is severely limited in its capability during actual deployment due to financial constraints  With the exception of the very first unit  all of the remaining 8A4 ROUVs have their TMS deleted due to the budget cuts  resulting in significant reduction in performance   For example  the maximum operational depth is reduced by more than half  It is not until the early 2010s during the scheduled overhaul would the TMS be planned to be reintroduced to all the 8A4 ROUVs to achieve their full capability     7B8 ROUV   The 7B8 ROUV is a further development of the 8A4 ROUV  and it is a Chinese transition from ROUV to   Autonomous underwater vehicle    AUV    Designed by the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of   Harbin Engineering University    HEU  based on the experience of the 8A4 ROUV with Mr  Deng Sanrui       as the general designer  the 7B8 ROUV was first revealed to the Chinese public in   Beijing   during the National Science and Technology Exhibition of the   People s Liberation Army   at the   Military Museum of the Chinese People s Revolution   in 1995 while still under development  and members of the   Central Military Commission  People s Republic of China  Central Military Commission   headed by General   Liu Huaqing   was among those special guests   The 7B8 ROUV is unique in that in comparison to other Chinese ROUVs  it can also operate independently as an AUV in addition to being operated remotely via tether cable like ordinary ROUVs  The 7B8 first completed its trials as an ROUV in the 1990s and in 2000  Then it completed AUV trials including autonomously searching underwater targets and autonomous underwater work  and subsequently entered service   When the 7B8 is operated as an AUV  the maximum operating depth is less than when operating as an ROUV   Specifications

performance   and accuracy  it enjoys widespread use    Peter E  Hart Peter Hart      Nils Nilsson  researcher  Nils Nilsson    and   Bertram Raphael   first described the algorithm in 1968 ref   cite

ref   It is an extension of Edsger Dijkstra s   Dijkstra s algorithm 1959 algorithm    A  achieves better performance  with respect to time  by using   heuristics       Description    A  uses a   best first search best first   search and finds the least cost path from a given initial   node  graph theory  node   to one   goal node    out of one or more possible goals    It uses a distance plus cost   heuristic   function  usually denoted  math f x   math   to determine the order in which the search visits nodes in the tree  The distance plus cost heuristic is a sum of two functions     the path cost function  which is the cost from the starting node to the current node  usually denoted  math g x   math     and an   Admissible heuristic admissible    heuristic estimate  of the distance to the goal  usually denoted  math h x   math     The  math h x   math  part of the  math f x   math  function must be an   admissible heuristic    that is  it must not overestimate the distance to the goal  Thus  for an application like   routing     math h x   math  might represent the straight line distance to the goal  since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points or nodes   If the   heuristic     h   satisfies the additional condition  math h x   le d x y    h y   math  for every edge   x  y   of the graph  where   d   denotes the length of that edge   then   h   is called   Consistent heuristic monotone  or consistent    In such a case  A  can be implemented more efficiently roughly speaking  no node needs to be processed more than once  see   closed set   below  and A  is equivalent to running   Dijkstra s algorithm   with the   reduced cost    math d  x  y     d x  y    h x    h y   math    Note that A  has been generalized into a bidirectional heuristic search algorithm  see   bidirectional search       History   In 1964 Nils Nilsson invented a heuristic based approach to increase the speed of Dijkstra s algorithm  This algorithm was called A1  In 1967 Bertram Raphael made dramatic improvements upon this algorithm  but failed to show optimality  He called this algorithm A2  Then in 1968 Peter E  Hart introduced an argument that proved A2 was optimal when using a consistent heuristic with only minor changes  His proof of the algorithm also included a section that showed that the new A2 algorithm was the best algorithm possible given the conditions  He thus named the new algorithm in   Kleene star   syntax to be the algorithm that starts with A and includes all possible version numbers or A    ref http   www eecs berkeley edu  klein    ref     Concepts    As A  traverses the graph  it follows a path of the lowest   known   cost  keeping a sorted   priority queue   of alternate path segments along the way  If  at any point  a segment of the path being traversed has a higher cost than another encountered path segment  it abandons the higher cost path segment and traverses the lower cost path segment instead  This process continues until the goal is reached     Process      Image A  Pathfinding Algorithm png thumb A single step simulation   Like all   informed search algorithm  s  it first searches the routes that   appear   to be most likely to lead towards the goal  What sets A  apart from a   greedy algorithm greedy     best first search   is that it also takes the distance already traveled into account  the  math g x   math  part of the heuristic is the cost from the start  not simply the local cost from the previously expanded node   Starting with the initial node  it maintains a   priority queue   of nodes to be traversed  known as the   open set    not to be confused with   open set  s in   topology     The lower  math f x   math  for a given node  math x  math   the higher its priority  At each step of the algorithm  the node with the lowest  math f x   math  value is removed from the queue  the  math f  math  and  math h  math  values of its neighbors are updated accordingly  and these neighbors are added to the queue  The algorithm continues until a goal node has a lower  math f  math  value than any node in the queue  or until the queue is empty    Goal nodes may be passed over multiple times if there remain other nodes with lower  math f  math  values  as they may lead to a shorter path to a goal   The  math f  math  value of the goal is then the length of the shortest path  since  math h  math  at the goal is zero in an admissible heuristic  If the actual shortest path is desired  the algorithm may also update each neighbor with its immediate predecessor in the best path found so far  this information can then be used to reconstruct the path by working backwards from the goal node  Additionally  if the heuristic is   monotonic    or   Consistent heuristic consistent    see below   a   closed set   of nodes already traversed may be used to make the search more efficient     Pseudocode    The following   pseudocode   describes the algorithm   source lang

search    A  is   complete   and will always find a solution if one exists   If the heuristic function  math h  math  is   Admissible heuristic admissible    meaning that it never overestimates the actual minimal cost of reaching the goal  then A  is itself admissible  or   optimal    if we do not use a closed set  If a closed set is used  then  math h  math  must also be   monotonic    or   Consistent heuristic consistent    for A  to be optimal  This means that for any pair of adjacent nodes  math x  math  and  math y  math   where  math d x y   math  denotes the length of the edge between them  we must have     math h x   le d x y    h y   math   This ensures that for any path  math X  math  from the initial node to  math x  math      math L X    h x   le L X    d x y    h y    L Y    h y   math   where  math L  cdot   math  denotes the length of a path  and  math Y  math  is the path  math X  math  extended to include  math y  math   In other words  it is impossible to decrease  total distance so far   estimated remaining distance  by extending a path to include a neighboring node   This is analogous to the restriction to nonnegative edge weights in   Dijkstra s algorithm     Monotonicity implies admissibility when the heuristic estimate at any goal node itself is zero  since  letting  math P    f v 1 v 2  ldots v n g   math  be a shortest path from any node  math f  math  to the nearest goal  math g  math       math h f   le d f v 1    h v 1   le d f v 1    d v 1 v 2    h v 2   le  ldots  le L P    h g    L P   math   A  is also optimally efficient for any heuristic  math h  math   meaning that no algorithm employing the same heuristic will expand fewer nodes than A   except when there are multiple partial solutions where  math h  math  exactly predicts the cost of the optimal path  Even in this case  for each graph there exists some order of breaking ties in the priority queue such that A  examines the fewest possible nodes      Special cases      Dijkstra s algorithm    as another example of a uniform cost search search algorithm  can be viewed as a special case of A  where  math h x    0  math  for all  math x  math   General   depth first search   can be implemented using the A  by considering that there is a global counter   C   initialized with a very large value  Every time we process a node we assign   C   to all of its newly discovered neighbors  After each single assignment  we decrease the counter   C   by one  Thus the earlier a node is discovered  the higher its  math h x   math  value   It should be noted  however  that both Dijkstra s algorithm and depth first search can be implemented more efficiently without including a  math h x   math  value at each node      Implementation details    There are a number of simple optimizations or implementation details that can significantly affect the performance of an A  implementation   The first detail to note is that the way the priority queue handles ties can have a significant effect on performance in some situations   If ties are broken so the queue behaves in a   LIFO  computing  LIFO   manner  A  will behave like   depth first search   among equal cost paths    When a path is required at the end of the search  it is common to keep with each node a reference to that node s parent   At the end of the search these references can be used to recover the optimal path   If these references are being kept then it can be important that the same node doesn t appear in the priority queue more than once  each entry corresponding to a different path to the node  and each with a different cost    A standard approach here is to check if a node about to be added already appears in the priority queue   If it does  then the priority and parent pointers are changed to correspond to the lower cost path   When finding a node in a queue to perform this check  many standard implementations of a   Heap  data structure  min heap   require  math O n   math  time   Augmenting the heap with a   hash table   can reduce this to constant time     Admissibility and optimality  anchor Admissibility and Optimality     A  is admissible and considers fewer nodes than any other admissible search algorithm with the same heuristic  This is because A  uses an  optimistic  estimate of the cost of a path through every node that it considers optimistic in that the true cost of a path through that node to the goal will be at least as great as the estimate  But  critically  as far as A   knows   that optimistic estimate might be achievable   Here is the main idea of the proof   When A  terminates its search  it has found a path whose actual cost is lower than the estimated cost of any path through any open node  But since those estimates are optimistic  A  can safely ignore those nodes  In other words  A  will never overlook the possibility of a lower cost path and so is admissible   Suppose now that some other search algorithm B terminates its search with a path whose actual cost is   not   less than the estimated cost of a path through some open node  Based on the heuristic information it has  Algorithm B cannot rule out the possibility that a path through that node has a lower cost  So while B might consider fewer nodes than A   it cannot be admissible  Accordingly  A  considers the fewest nodes of any admissible search algorithm   This is only true if both     A  uses an   admissible heuristic    Otherwise  A  is not guaranteed to expand fewer nodes than another search algorithm with the same heuristic  See

227|A20 line|  refimprove date October 2010   The    A20    or   addressing line 20   is one of the plethora of   electrical   lines that make up the   system bus   of an   x86   based computer system  The A20 line in particular is used to transmit the 21st bit on the   address bus     A microprocessor will typically have a number of addressing lines equal to the base two   logarithm   of its physical addressing space  For example a processor with 4   Gibibyte GiB   of physical addressing space requires 32 lines  which are named A0 through A31  The lines are named after the number of the bit in the address they are transmitting  Thus  A0 will transmit the   least significant bit    which is bit 0  A20 transmits bit 21 and will become active once addresses reach 1   Mebibyte MiB   or 2 sup 20  sup      File IBM PC Memory areas svg thumb right The high memory area is available in real mode on 80286 processors if the A20 gate is not disabled       History    The early   Intel 8086      Intel 8088    and   Intel 80186   processors had 20 address lines  numbered A0 to A19  with these the processor can access 2 sup 20  sup  bytes or 1   Mebibyte MiB    The processors were designed to access only blocks   segments   of 64   Kibibyte KiB   directly  64KiB   2 sup 16  sup    16 bit offset   Which chunk of physical memory this offset actually pointed to  was pre selected with a 16 bit  segment register  which could be moved in steps of 16 bytes  The resulting address is equal to Segment   16   Offset   In consequence there were various ways to address the same byte in memory  Exemplary  four of 4096 different segment offset combinations  all referencing the byte whose physical address is 0x000FFFFF  the last byte in 1 MiB memory space   are    F000 FFFF  FFFF 000F  F555 AAAF  F800 7FFF   Referenced the last way  an increase of one in the offset yields F800 8000  which is a proper address for the processor  but since it translates to the physical address 0x00100000  the first byte over 1 MiB  the processor would need another address line to actually access this byte  Since such a line doesn t exist on the 8086 line of processors  the 21 sup st  sup  bit above  while set  gets dropped  causing the address F800 8000 to  wrap around  and to actually point to the physical address 0x0000000    Because loading segment registers was very slow on early processors  this trick was used by some DOS programmers  for example  to have one segment that has access to program data  e g  from F800 0000 to F800 7FFF  pointing to the physical addresses 0x000F8000   0x000FFFFF  as well as the I O data  e g  keyboard buffer  that was located in the first memory segment  with addresses F800 8000 to F800 FFFF pointing to the physical addresses 0x00000000 to 0x00007FFF    Citation needed date December 2010    When   IBM   designed the   IBM PC AT   machine  they decided to use the new higher performance   Intel 80286   microprocessor  The 80286 could address up to 16   Mebibyte MiB   of system memory  thus removing the ability for memory addresses to wrap around  Since the required address line now existed  the combination F800 8000 would no longer point to the physical address 0x0000000 but the correct address 0x00100000  As a result some DOS programs would no longer work  In order to remain compatible with these programs  IBM decided to fix the problem themselves  on the   motherboard     This was accomplished by inserting a   logic gate   on the A20 line between the processor and system bus  which logically got named   Gate A20    Gate A20 can be enabled or disabled by software to allow or prevent the address bus from receiving a signal from A20  It is set to non passing for the execution of older programs which rely on the wrap around  At boot time  the   BIOS   first enables Gate A20 when counting and testing all of the system s memory  and disables it before transferring control to the operating system   Originally  the logic gate was a gate connected to the   Intel 8042   keyboard controller  Controlling it was a relatively slow process  Other methods have since been added to allow for more efficient multitasking of programs which require this wrap around with programs that access all of the system s memory  There was at first a variety of methods  but eventually the industry settled on the PS 2 method of using a bit in port 92h to control the A20 line   Disconnecting A20 would not wrap    all    memory accesses above 1 MiB  just those in the 1 MiB 2 MiB  3 MiB 4 MiB  5 MiB 6 MiB  etc  ranges    Real mode   software only cared about the area slightly above 1 MiB  so Gate A20 was enough   Enabling the Gate A20 line is one of the first steps a   protected mode     x86     operating system   does in the bootup process  often before control has been passed onto the kernel from the   booting bootstrap    in the case of Linux  for example      Virtual 8086 mode    introduced with the   Intel 80386    allows the A20 wrap around to be simulated by using the   virtual memory   facilities of the processor  physical memory may be mapped to multiple virtual addresses thus allowing the memory mapped at first mebibyte of virtual memory may be mapped again in the second mebibyte of virtual memory  The operating system may intercept changes to Gate A20 and make corresponding changes to the virtual memory address space  which also makes irrelevant the efficiency of Gate A20 toggling     A20 handler   The    A20 handler    is   IBM PC     memory manager   software controlling access to the   high memory area    HMA     Extended memory   managers usually provide this functionality  A20 handlers are named after the 21st address line of the microprocessor  the A20 line   In MS DOS    high memory area   managers  such as   HIMEM SYS   has the  extra task  of managing A20    HIMEM SYS   provided an   API   for opening closing A20  DOS itself could utilize the area for some of its storage needs  thereby freeing up more conventional memory for programs  This functionality was enabled by the  DOS HIGH  directive in the   CONFIG SYS   configuration file     A20 gate   Controlling the A20 line was an important feature at one stage in the growth of the IBM PC architecture  as it added access to an additional 65520 bytes  64 KiB   16 B  of memory in   real mode   without dramatic software changes   In what was arguably a  hack   the A20 gate was originally part of the keyboard controller on the motherboard  which could open close it depending on what behaviour was desired   ref  Tom Shanley  Don Anderson  John Swindle     ISA system architecture    Addison Wesley  1995  ISBN 0 201 40996 8  pp 79 80   ref   The A20 gate is still present on all modern PC s and the gate is initially closed right after boot  Modern   protected mode   operating systems typically open the A20 gate early during the boot process and never close it again  These operating systems do not have the compatibility reasons for keeping it closed and they gain access to the full range of physical addresses available by opening it   The   Intel 80486   and   Pentium   added a special pin named   A20M     which when asserted low forces bit 20 of the physical address to be zero for all on chip cache or external memory accesses  This enhancement is mostly significant for mainboard manufacturers  because it makes parts of the external Gate A20 circuitry unnecessary  Software still needs to manipulate the gate and must still deal with external peripherals  the   chipset    for that   ref  Tom

244|AA tree|An    AA tree    in   computer science   is a form of   Self balancing binary search tree balanced tree   used for storing and retrieving ordered data efficiently  AA trees are named for   Arne Andersson  computer science  Arne Andersson    their inventor   AA trees are a variation of the   red black tree    which in turn is an enhancement to the   binary search tree    Unlike red black trees  red nodes on an AA tree can only be added as a right subchild  In other words  no red node can be a left sub child   This results in the simulation of a   2 3 tree   instead of a   2 3 4 tree    which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations  The maintenance algorithms for a red black tree need to consider seven different shapes to properly balance the tree     Image Red Black Shape Cases svg    An AA tree on the other hand only needs to consider two shapes due to the strict requirement that only right links can be red     Image AA Tree Shape Cases svg       Balancing Rotations     Typically  AA trees are implemented with levels instead of colors  unlike red black trees   Each node has a level field  and the following invariants must remain true for the tree to be valid     The level of a leaf node is one    The level of a left child is strictly less than that of its parent    The level of a right child is less than or equal to that of its parent    The level of a right grandchild is strictly less than that of its grandparent    Every node of level greater than one must have two children   Only two operations are needed for maintaining balance in an AA tree  These operations are called skew and split  Skew is a right rotation when an insertion or deletion creates a left horizontal  Clarify What s a   horizontal link    date July 2010   link  which can be thought of as a left red link in the red black tree context  Split is a conditional left rotation when an insertion or deletion creates two horizontal right links  which once again corresponds to two consecutive red links in red black trees        function    skew    is            input     T  a node representing an AA tree that needs to be rebalanced          output     Another node representing the rebalanced AA tree            if    nil T     then                return    Nil         else if    level left T      level T     then               Swap the pointers of horizontal left links

   nil T     then                return    Nil         else if    level T     level right right T       then               We have two horizontal right links   Take the middle node  elevate it  and return it             R   right T           right T     left R           left R     T          level R     level R    1             return    R         else                return    T         end if        end function     Split    Image AA Tree Split2 svg       Insertion     Insertion begins with the normal binary tree search and insertion procedure   Then  as the call stack unwinds  assuming a recursive implementation of the search   it s easy to check the validity of the tree and perform any rotations as necessary   If a horizontal left link arises  a skew will be performed  and if two horizontal right links arise  a split will be performed  possibly incrementing the level of the new root node of the current subtree   Note  in the code as given above  the increment of level T    This makes it necessary to continue checking the validity of the tree as the modifications bubble up from the leaves       function    insert    is            input     X  the value to be inserted  and T  the root of the tree to insert it into          output     A balanced version T including X           Do the normal binary tree insertion procedure   Set the result of the          recursive call to the correct child in case a new node was created or the          root of the subtree changes            if    nil T     then               Create a new leaf node with X                return    node X  1  Nil  Nil          else if    X   value T     then             left T     insert X  left T           else if    X   value T     then             right T     insert X  right T           end if           Note that the case of X    value T  is unspecified   As given  an insert      will have no effect   The implementor may desire different behavior             Perform skew and then split   The conditionals that determine whether or      not a rotation will occur or not are inside of the procedures  as given      above         T    skew T       T    split T            return T        end function        Deletion     As in most balanced binary trees  the deletion of an internal node can be turned into the deletion of a leaf node by swapping the internal node with either its closest predecessor or successor  depending on which are in the tree or on the implementor s whims   Retrieving a predecessor is simply a matter of following one left link and then all of the remaining right links   Similarly  the successor can be found by going right once and left until a null pointer is found   Because of the AA property of all nodes of level greater than one having two children  the successor or predecessor node will be in level 1  making their removal trivial   To re balance a tree  there are a few approaches   The one described by Andersson in his  http   user it uu se  arnea abs simp html original paper  is the simplest  and it is described here  although actual implementations may opt for a more optimized approach   After a removal  the first step to maintaining tree validity is to lower the level of any nodes whose children are two levels below them  or who are missing children   Then  the entire level must be skewed and split   This approach was favored  because when laid down conceptually  it has three easily understood separate steps     Decrease the level  if appropriate    Skew the level    Split the level   However  we have to skew and split the entire level this time instead of just a node  complicating our code       function    delete    is            input     X  the value to delete  and T  the root of the tree from which it should be deleted          output     T  balanced  without the value X            if    X   value T     then             right T     delete X  right T           else if    X   value T     then             left T     delete X  left T           else               If we re a leaf  easy  otherwise reduce to leaf case                 if    leaf T     then                 return Nil             else if    nil left T      then                 L    successor T               right T     delete L  right T                value T     L             else                 L    predecessor T               left T     delete L  left T                value T     L             end if            end if             Rebalance the tree   Decrease the level of all nodes in this level if      necessary  and then skew and split all nodes in the new level         T    decrease level T       T    skew T       right T     skew right T        right right T      skew right right T         T    split T       right T     split right T        return T     end function         function    decrease level    is            input     T  a tree for which we want to remove links that skip levels          output     T with its level

then                 level right T      should be             end if            end if         return T     end function     A good example of deletion by this algorithm is present in the  http   user it uu se  arnea abs simp html Andersson paper       Performance     The performance of an AA tree is equivalent to the performance of a red black tree  While an AA tree makes more rotations than a red black tree  the simpler algorithms tend to be faster  and all of this balances out to result in similar performance  A red black tree is more consistent in its performance than an AA tree  but an AA tree tends to be flatter  which results in slightly faster search times   Citation needed date February 2007       See also        Red black tree       B tree       AVL tree      References     http

Alternating current AC     waveform   such as the mains supply  to another AC waveform  where the output voltage and frequency can be set arbitrarily   AC AC converters can be categorized into    Converters with a DC link      Cycloconverter  s   Hybrid Matrix Converters    Matrix Converters  As shown in Fig 1  For such AC AC conversion today typically converter systems with a voltage  Fig  2  or current  Fig  3  DC link are employed  For the voltage DC link  the mains coupling could be implemented by a diode bridge  To accomplish braking operation of a motor  a braking resistor must be placed in the DC link  Alternatively  an anti parallel thyristor bridge must be provided on the mains side for feeding back energy into the mains  The disadvantages of this solution are the relatively high mains distortion and high reactive power requirements  especially during inverter operation     An AC AC converter with approximately sinusoidal input currents and bidirectional power flow can be realized by coupling a PWM rectifier and a PWM inverter to the DC link  The DC link quantity is then impressed by an energy storage element that is common to both stages  which is a capacitor C for the voltage DC link or an inductor L for the current DC link  The PWM rectifier is controlled in a way that a sinusoidal mains current is drawn  which is in phase or anti phase  for energy feedback  with the corresponding mains phase voltage    Due to the DC link storage element  there is the advantage that both converter stages are to a large extent decoupled for control purposes  Furthermore  a constant  mains independent input quantity exists for the PWM inverter stage  which results in high utilization of the converter s power capability  On the other hand  the DC link energy storage element has a relatively large physical volume  and when electrolytic capacitors are used  in the case of a voltage DC link  there is potentially a reduced system lifetime    In order to achieve higher power density and reliability  it is makes sense to consider Matrix Converters that achieve three phase AC AC conversion without any intermediate energy storage element  Conventional Direct Matrix Converters  Fig  4  perform voltage and current conversion in one single stage    A   cycloconverter   constructs an output  variable frequency  approximately sinusoid waveform by switching segments of the input waveform to the output  there is no intermediate DC link   With switching elements such as   SCR  s  the output frequency must be lower than the input  Very large cycloconverters  on the order of 10 MW  are manufactured for compressor and wind tunnel drives  or for variable speed applications such as   cement   kilns      There is the alternative option of indirect energy conversion by employing the Indirect Matrix Converter  Fig  5  or the Sparse Matrix Converter which was invented by Prof  Johann W  Kolar from the ETH Zurich  As with the DC link based systems  Fig  2 and Fig  3   separate stages are provided for voltage and current conversion  but the DC link has no intermediate storage element  Generally  by employing matrix converters  the storage element in the DC link is eliminated at the cost of a larger number of semiconductors  Matrix converters are often seen as a future concept for variable speed drives technology  but despite intensive research over the decades they have until now only achieved low industrial penetration  The reason for this could be the higher complexity in modulation and analysis effort      References     Reflist      Category

273|ACCESS bus|  Unreferenced date April 2008       ACCESS bus     or    A b     is a peripheral interconnect   computer bus   developed by   Philips   in the early 1990s  It is similar in purpose to   Universal Serial Bus USB    in that it allows low speed devices to be added or removed from a computer on the fly  While it was in use earlier than USB  it never became popular  largely due to considerably less corporate backing in the industry   A b is a   physical layer   definition that describes the physical cabling and connectors used in the network  The higher layers  namely the signaling and protocol issues  are already defined to be the same as Philips    I C   bus   Compared to I C  A b     adds two additional pins to provide power to the devices   5 V and GND    allows for only 125 devices out of I C s 1024   supports only the 100 kbit s  standard mode  and 10 kbit s  low speed mode   The idea was to define a single standard that could be used both inside and outside a computer  A single I C A b controller chip would be used inside the machine  connected on the   motherboard   to internal devices like the clock and battery power monitor  An A b connector on the outside would then allow additional devices to be plugged into the bus  This way all of the low  and medium speed devices on the machine would be driven by a single controller and   protocol stack     A b also defined a small set of standardized device classes  These included monitors  keyboards   locators   pointing devices like mice and joysticks   battery monitors  and  text devices   modems  etc    Depending on how much intelligence the device needed  the interface in the device could leave almost all of the work to the   device driver driver    This allows A b to scale down to price points low enough for devices like mice   Although A b mice and keyboards have been available  in limited fashion  for some time  the only serious attempt to use the system was by the   VESA   group  They needed a standardized bus for communicating device abilities between monitors and computers  and selected I C because it required only two pins  by re using existing  reserved  pins in the standard   VGA   they could implement a complete A b bus  including power   A number of monitors with A b connectors started appearing in the mid 1990s  notably those by   NEC    but this was at about the same time USB was being heavily promoted and few devices were available to plug into them  The bus remained the standard way for a monitor to communicate setup information to the host graphics card   Compared to USB  A b has several advantages  One is that any device on the bus can be a master or a slave  and a protocol is defined for selecting which one a device should use under any particular circumstance  This allows devices to be plugged together with A b without a host computer  For instance  a digital camera could be plugged directly into a printer and become the master  Under USB the computer is always the master and the devices are always slaves  In order to support the same sort of device to device connection  USB requires additional support in the dual role devices in order to emulate a host and provide similar functionality  Another advantage of A b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy chain mdash A b can support  but does not require  the use of hubs  This can reduce cable clutter significantly   On the downside  A b is much slower than USB  Had   FireWire IEEE 1394    also known as FireWire  been widely available at the time  a computer with both A b and FireWire would have been an attractive solution for all speed ranges  As it was  USB fit neatly into the niche between the two  With USB soon included in the standard motherboard control chips from   Intel    A b was pushed out onto the low end and quickly disappeared     External links      http   www interfacebus com Design Connector I2C html I sup 2  sup C Bus   Access Bus     Computer bus      Category computer buses      de ACCESS bus     fi ACCESS bus

regions on six continents  the ICPC is directed by Baylor Professor William B  Poucher  Executive Director  and operates under the auspices of the   Association for Computing Machinery    ACM      History   The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest    ICPC    traces its roots to a competition held at   Texas A M University   in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the   Upsilon Pi Epsilon   Computer Science Honor Society  UPE   The contest evolved into its present form as a multi tier competition in 1977  with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference   From 1977 to 1989  the contest included mainly teams from   United States U S    and   Canada     Headquartered at   Baylor University   since 1989  with regionals established within the world s university community  operating under the auspices of ACM  and with substantial industry support  the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition with teams from 84 countries in 2005   Since the beginning of   IBM   s sponsorship in 1997  contest participation has grown enormously  In 1997  840 teams from 560 universities participated  In 2007  6 700 teams from 1 821 universities participated  The number of teams keeps increasing by 10 20  every year and future competitions may be even larger   The World Finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals  ACM ICPC World Finals  is the final round of competition   Over its history it has become a 4 day event held in the finest venues worldwide     Upsilon Pi Epsilon UPE   recognizes all of the regional champions at the event  Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country s head of state and at the annual ACM Awards Ceremony     Contest rules   The ICPC is a team competition  Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students  Participants must be university students  who have had less than five years of university education before the contest  Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again  ref   cite web url http   icpc baylor edu icpc info default htm title

Regionals Eligibility Decision Diagram accessdate 2008 06 10 format PDF    ref   During contest  the teams are given 5 hours to solve between 8 and 12 programming problems  with 8 typical for regionals and 10 for finals   They must submit solutions as programs in   C  programming language  C      C      or   Java  programming language  Java    Programs are then run on test data  If a program fails to give a correct answer  the team is notified about that and they can submit another program    The winner is the team which correctly solves most problems  If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams  the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved   For example  consider a situation when two teams  Red and Blue  tie by solving two problems each  The team Red submitted their solutions to A and B at 1 00 and 2 45 after the beginning of the contest  They had a rejected run on C  but it was ignored since they didn t solve C   The team Blue submitted solutions to problems A and C at 1 20 and 2 00 after the beginning  They had one rejected run on C   Then  the total time is 1 00 2 45 3 45 for team Red and 1 20 2 00 0 20 3 40 for team Blue   The tie is broken in favor of Team Blue   Compared to other programming contests  for example    International Olympiad in Informatics     the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems  8 or more problems in just 5 hours   Another feature is that each team can use only one computer  although teams have three students  This makes the time pressure even greater  Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win     Regionals and World Finals   The contest consists of several stages  Many universities hold local contests to determine participants at the regional level  Then  universities compete in Regional contests  Winners of Regional contests advance to the   ACM ICPC World Finals    More than one team from a university can compete in regionals  but only one may compete at the world finals   From each region  at least one team goes to World Finals  Regions with large number of teams send multiple teams to finals  sometimes as many as 6 teams from one very large region      No participant can take part in more than two World Finals    Some large regions also hold Subregional competitions  also called Preliminaries  which are intermediate between local and regional contests    In ACM ICPC  the result has seven different expressions  AC  WA  RTE  TLE  PE  MLE  CE  The result AC means the code is accepted by the system     2004 World Finals   The 2004 ACM ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum

317|AD AS model|  Cleanup date November 2008   The    AD AS    or    Aggregate Demand Aggregate Supply model    is a   macroeconomic model   that explains   price level   and   output  economics  output   through the relationship of   aggregate demand   and   aggregate supply    It is based on the theory of   John Maynard Keynes   presented in his work     The General Theory of Employment  Interest  and Money      One of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of   macroeconomics    and is used by a broad array of economists  from   libertarian      Monetarist   supporters of   laissez faire    such as   Milton Friedman   to   Post Keynesian economics Post Keynesian   supporters of   economic interventionism    such as   Joan Robinson       Modeling   The AD AS model is used to illustrate the   Keynesian economics Keynesian   model of the   business cycle    Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various   exogeny exogenous   events will have on two variables   real   GDP   and the   price level     Furthermore  the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models  models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time    The AD AS model can be related to the   Phillips curve   model of wage or price inflation and unemployment     Aggregate demand curve     main Aggregate Demand   The AD curve is defined by the IS LM equilibrium income at different potential price levels   The equation for the AD curve in general terms is      math Y Y  d   tfrac M  P   G  T  Z 1   math   where Y is real   GDP    M is the nominal   money supply    G is real   government spending    T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied  P is the   price level    and Z sub 1  sub  is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve  exogenous influences on any component of spending  or the LM curve  exogenous influences on money demand    The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand  as does real government spending  meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction  aggregate demand changes in the same direction   the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it     Aggregate supply curve     main Aggregate supply   The aggregate supply curve may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium  In either case  it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels   The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market  called the short run aggregate supply curve  is     math Y Y  s  W P       P P  e        Z 2   math   where W is the nominal wage rate  exogenous due to stickiness in the short run   P sup e  sup  is the anticipated  expected  price level  and Z sub 2  sub  is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve  the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge    The real wage has a negative effect on firms  employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply   The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms  mistakes in production plans due to mis predictions of prices   The long run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally  as would be the terminology in the micro economic theory of the firm   but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate   In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation   The long run aggregate supply equation is simply   math Y Y  s  Z 2   math   and is vertical at the full employment level of output  In this long run case  Z sub 2  sub  also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve  such as population   since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome     Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply   The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right   Of course  exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction      Shifts of aggregate demand    The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right   As a result  the price level would go up   In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run  so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical  real output would go up  but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment  real output would remain unchanged   Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve    An exogenous increase in consumer spending   An exogenous increase in investment  spending on   physical capital     An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment    An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services   An exogenous increase in   transfer payments   from the government to the people   An exogenous decrease in taxes levied   An exogenous increase in purchases of the country s exports by people in other countries   An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries  Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve    An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply   An exogenous decrease in the demand for money  in liquidity preference      Shifts of aggregate supply    The following exogenous events would shift the short run aggregate supply curve to the right   As a result  the price level would drop and real GDP would increase    An exogenous decrease in the wage rate   An increase in the physical capital stock   Technological progress  mdash  improvements in our

321|ADAPA|  Fanpov date August 2010       This article is about a decision engine  For the Babylonian and Summerian god of wisdom  see   Adapa           ADAPA    is intrinsically a predictive decisioning platform  It combines the power of   predictive analytics   and   business rules   to facilitate the tasks of managing and designing automated decisioning systems      Automated decisions   When first released  ADAPA  Adaptive Decision And Predictive Analytics  was purely a scoring engine  used to produce scores out of   statistical model  s expressed in   PMML    Predictive Model Markup Language  format  With the addition of a rules engine to its core  ADAPA is now able to seamlessly combine rules and predictive models  which enables businesses to manage and design automated decisioning systems  In this way  ADAPA allows for the concretization of   Enterprise Decision Management    EDM  solutions     PMML support and predictive analytics     Predictive analytics   comprises a series of modeling techniques which can be used to extract relevant patterns present in large amounts of data to better predict the future   ADAPA is able to generate scores out of a variety of predictive modeling techniques expressed in   PMML    PMML provides a standard way for the expression of predictive models  In this way  proprietary issues and incompatibilities are no longer a barrier to the exchange of models between applications    Currently  ADAPA supports the following PMML elements     File ADAPA3 0 TwoinOne png right 350px H3         Decision tree learning Decision Trees       Neural Networks     Clustering Models   Naive Bayes Classifiers     Support Vector Machines     Ruleset Models   Linear and   Logistic regression   as well as all general regression PMML models     Multinomial Logistic    General Linear    Ordinal Multinomial    Simple Regression      Generalized linear model      Cox Regression Models  as well as a variety of elements involved in data pre  and post processing     Built in Functions  logic and arithmetic operators as well as IF THEN ELSE    Normalization   Discretization   Value Mapping   Functions   Targets Scaling   Outputs   Model Verification  which in ADAPA can also take the form of a CSV file   Once a model is uploaded in ADAPA  it can be executed in batch and real time  ADAPA is a PMML consumer  therefore it is able to execute PMML code exported from tools such as R  SPSS  IBM  SAS  KNIME  KXEN  RapidMiner  etc    Besides offering a web based console to manage models and rule sets  ADAPA includes capabilities to test these under its decision and validation framework     Business rules      Business rules   allow for business process and logic to be expressed outside of programming code  With ADAPA  the integration of predictive analytics and rules is seamless  Simply put  ADAPA allows both data driven and expert knowledge to be combined into a single and concise solution  executed in real time or in batch mode    ADAPA allows for business knowledge to be expressed in simple tabular format  In ADAPA  rules can be used to manage the execution of different predictive models depending on the business context  They can also incorporate scores generated by different predictive models throughout the business process  The acting together of the two technologies has the potential to significantly extend the precision of any decision logic    ADAPA rules leverage the power of the leading Java   open source   rules engine   Drools   which is supported by a strong community of developers and JBoss  a division of   Red Hat    This fast  highly efficient rules engine has proven its excellence in numerous commercial installations    All decisions in ADAPA are readily available by the use of   Web Services       ADAPA To Go      PMML Converter      Zementis Inc    the maker of ADAPA  has released a PMML converter as an iGoogle gadget  This allows for users to convert older PMML models  versions 2 0  2 1  3 0  3 1  and 3 2  to version 4 0  Besides schema validation  the PMML Converter automatically corrects known issues with PMML code from several sources vendors  The aim is to successfully validate code in older versions of PMML and convert them to PMML 4 0  Files in PMML 4 0 can also be passed through the converter so that they can be corrected and validated against the 4 0 schema   The PMML Converter is also embedded in ADAPA itself  And so  if you use ADAPA  there is no need to convert your files  ADAPA will automatically do that for you      Software as a Service on the Amazon Cloud    ADAPA predictive analytics is available through the   Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud    Amazon EC2   It provides the first   SaaS    Software as a Service  predictive decisioning platform  The user can upload and manage several rule sets as well as models expressed in PMML and score data in real time through the use of web service calls  ADAPA will automatically convert older versions of PMML to version 3 2 and correct any known issues from different vendors   ADAPA as a Service empowers people  since it allows for anyone anywhere to deploy and use state of the art data mining models      ADAPA Add in for Microsoft Office Excel    To make the process of executing predictive models even simpler  Zementis also offers the ADAPA add in for Excel 2007 and 2010  available for free   With the add in  anyone in the enterprise is able to score data in Excel by executing models previously deployed in the Cloud   ADAPA allows for real time data scoring at any time a new event occurs since it can be used from inside any application via Web Service Calls  Excel is just one such application which happens to be a very well known tool  used by many   This is remarkable  since it frees users from having to deal with all the technology required for scoring their data whenever necessary  With the Excel add in  all one has to do is to select which data records to score  or the columns and rows containing the relevant data  and pressing on the  Score  button in Excel   et voila    new predictions are generated automatically for all selected records     ADAPA Flavors   ADAPA is currently being offered in two ways     http   www zementis com on the cloud htm On the Cloud   launch your own private instances of ADAPA on the Amazon Cloud       http

Dartmouth conference  Turing proposed a  child machine  which could be taught in the human manner to attain adult human level intelligence  In latter days  the contention that an AI system could be built to learn and improve itself indefinitely has acquired the label of the bootstrap fallacy  Attempts in AI to implement such a system have met with consistent failure for half a century  Technological optimists  however  have maintained that a such system is possible  producing  if implemented  a feedback loop that would lead to a rapid exponential increase in intelligence  We examine

of  new AI   embodiment  situatedness  absence of reasoning  and absence of representation  are all present in conventional systems   New AI  is just like old AI  Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agents Which  however  turns out to be crucial  Some of more recent cognitive science suggests that we might do well to dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors  If this paradigm shift is achieved  Brooks  proposal for cognition without representation appears promising for full blown intelligent

notion of coherence  Admirably  Paul Thagard has attempted to give a computationally detailed account of the kind of coherence involved in practical reasoning  claiming that it will help overcome problems in foundationalist approaches to ethics  The arguments herein rebut the alleged role of coherence in practical reasoning endorsed by Thagard  While there are some general lessons to be learned from the preceding  no attempt is made to argue against all forms of coherence in all contexts  Nor is the usefulness of computational modelling called into question  The point will be that coherence cannot be as useful in understanding moral reasoning as coherentists may think  This result has clear implications for the future of Machine Ethics  a newly emerging subfield of AI      ref

 AIBO was discontinued in 2006     Overview   Being able to walk   see  its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands in Spanish and English  AIBO robotic pets are considered to be   autonomous robot  s since they are able to learn and mature based on external stimuli from their owner or environment  or from other AIBOs  Artist   Hajime Sorayama   created the initial designs for the AIBO   The original designs are part of the permanent collections of MoMA and the   Smithsonian Institution     The design won Sony and artist Sorayama the highest design award that may be conferred by Japan  On January 26  2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products as of March  2006 in Sony s effort to make the company more profitable  It also stopped development of the   QRIO   robot  AIBO will still be supported until 2013  ERS7 model  and AIBO technology will continue to be developed for use in other consumer products  ref   http   www sony net

new behaviors by reprogramming them  in Sony s special  R CODE  language   However  in October 2001  Sony sent a cease and desist notice to the webmaster of Aibopet  demanding that he stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the   copy protection   mechanisms of the robot   Eventually  in the face of many outraged AIBO owners  Sony released a programmer s kit for  non

History   ALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe  Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors  ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development     John Backus   developed the   Backus Naur Form Backus normal form   method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58  It was revised and expanded by   Peter Naur   for ALGOL 60  and at   Donald Knuth   s suggestion renamed   Backus Naur Form    ref Knuth  Donald E   1964  Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form  Communications of the ACM 7 12

Nevertheless  diligence persisted during the entire period  The chemistry of the 13 was excellent    Both John Backus and Peter Naur served on the committee which created ALGOL 60 as did   Wally

bits  Depending on addressing mode  each word could be viewed as either 1 48 bit word  2 24 bit half words  6 8 bit characters    EBCDIC   encoded  or 8 6 bit bytes  A 6 bit byte  as opposed to the 8 bit   byte   in common use today  was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time  The address space provided a maximum of 256K words   The   Instruction set ISA   was rather complicated for its time  The instructions were a fixed length of one word providing 24 bits for the operation and 24 bits for the address  The address consisted of 18 bits  3 bytes  for the memory address  with other bits used for the specification of index registers and indirect addressing   The operation field provided the operation code and a variety of modifiers  Some modifiers allowed instructions to operate only on specific bytes of a word or on specific bits of a byte without separate masking operations  Other modifiers allowed the single 48 bit   Arithmetic logic unit ALU   to operate on a pair of 24 bit operands to facilitate vector operations   Other parts of the CPU were some sense switches  which could be used to control various software functions  the run halt switch  and a switch  amplifier  and speaker assembly  which could be used to provide audio feedback or even play music  by connecting one of four bits in the main accumulator which could then be toggled under software control at an appropriate rate to produce whatever tones one wanted  Someone in the software development division had produced a card deck on which was stored an executive that allowed selecting from

450|ANOVA simultaneous component analysis|  multiple issues context November 2010 wikify November 2010 onesource November 2010       ASCA        ANOVA SCA     or    analysis of variance   simultaneous component analysis    is a method that partitions variation and enables interpretation of these partitions by SCA  a method that is similar to   Principal components analysis PCA    This method is a multi or even megavariate extension of   ANOVA    The variation partitioning is similar to Analysis of variance  ANOVA   Each partition matches all variation induced by an effect or factor  usually a treatment regime or experimental condition  The calculated effect partitions are called effect estimates  Because even the effect estimates are multivariate  interpretation of these effects estimates is not intuitive  By applying SCA on the effect estimates one gets a simple interpretable result  In case of more than one effect this method estimates the effects in such a way that the different effects are not correlated  See also references   http   dx doi org 10 1093 bioinformatics bti476    http   dx doi org 10 1002 cem 952  and  http   dx doi org 10 1186 1471 2105 8 322        Details     Many research areas see increasingly large numbers of variables in only few samples  The low sample to variable ratio creates problems known as   multicollinearity   and singularity  Because of this  most traditional multivariate statistical methods cannot be applied      ASCA algorithm     This section details how to calculate the ASCA model on a case of two main effects with one interaction effect  It is easy to extend the declared rationale to more main effects and more interaction effects  If the first effect is time and the second effect is dosage  only the interaction between time and dosage exist   We assume there are four time points and three dosage levels    Let X be a matrix that holds the data  X is mean centered  thus having zero mean columns  A1  A2  A3 and A4  as B1  B2 and B3 indicate the levels in time and dosage  A and B are required to be balanced if the effect estimates need to be orthogonal and the partitioning unique  Matrix E holds the information that is not assigned to any effect  The partitioning gives the following notation      math X   A B AB E     math      Calculating main effect estimate A  or B      Find all rows that correspond to effect A level 1 and averages these rows  The result is a vector  Repeat this for the other effect levels  Make a new matrix of the same size of X and place the calculated averages in the matching rows  That is  give all rows that match effect  i e   A level 1 the average of effect A level 1   After completing the level estimates for the effect  perform an SCA  The scores of this SCA are the sample deviations for the effect  the important variables of this effect are in the weights of the SCA loading vector      Calculating interaction effect estimate AB     Estimating the interaction effect is similar to estimating main effects  The difference is that for interaction estimates the rows that match effect A level 1 are combined with the effect B level 1 and all combinations of effects and levels are cycled through  In our example setting  with four time point and three dosage levels there are 12 interaction sets  A1 B1  A1B2  A2B1  A2B2 and so on   It is important to deflate  remove  the main effects before estimating the interaction effect      SCA on partitions A  B and AB     Simultaneous component analysis is mathematically identical to   Principal components analysis PCA    but is semantically different in that it models different objects or subjects at the same time   The standard notation for a SCA   and PCA   model is      math X TP     E     math   where   X   is the data    T   are the component scores and   P   are the component loadings    E   is the residual or error matrix  Because ASCA models the variation partitions by SCA  the model for effect estimates looks like this      math A T  a P  a      E  a      math      math B T  b P  b      E  b      math      math AB T  ab P  ab      E  ab      math      math E T  e P  e      E  e      math   Note that every partition has its own error matrix  However  algebra dictates that in a balanced mean centered data set every two level system is of rank one  This results in zero errors  since any rank 1 matrix can be written as the product of a single component score and loading vector   The full ASCA model with two effects and interaction including the SCA looks like this   Decomposition      math X A B AB E     math      math X T  a P  a      T  b P  b      T  ab P  ab      T  e P  e      E  a  E  b  E  ab  E  e  E     math      Time as an Effect     Because  time  is treated as a qualitative factor in the ANOVA decomposition preceding ASCA  a nonlinear multivariate time trajectory can be modeled  An example of this is shown in Figure 10 of this reference   http   www3 interscience wiley

455|ANSI art|   ANSI art    is a computer artform that was widely used at one time on   Bulletin board system BBSes    It is similar to   ASCII art    but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters  numbers  and symbols  mdash  all codes found in IBM   code page 437    often referred to as   extended ASCII   and used in   MS DOS   and   Unix   ref http   www cplusplus com doc ascii   ref  environments  ANSI art also contains special   ANSI escape code ANSI escape sequence  s that color text with the 16 foreground and 8 background colours offered by   ANSI SYS    an MS DOS   device driver   loosely based upon the   American National Standards Institute ANSI   X3 64 standard for   text terminal  s  Some ANSI artists take advantage of the cursor control sequences within ANSI X3 64 in order to create animations  commonly referred to as     ANSImation  s     ANSI art and text files which incorporate ANSI codes carry the   de facto    tt  ANS  tt    filename extension file extension      TOC   ANSI art is considerably more flexible than ASCII art  because the particular character set it uses contains symbols intended for drawing  such as a wide variety of box drawing characters and block characters that   dithering dither   the foreground and background color  It also adds accented characters and math symbols that often find creative use among ANSI artists   The popularity of ANSI art encouraged the creation of a powerful shareware package called   TheDraw   coded by Ian E  Davis in 1986  Not only did it considerably simplify the process of making an ANSI art screen from scratch  but it also included a variety of  fonts   large letters constructed from box and block characters  and transition animations such as   dissolve   and   clock    No new versions of TheDraw emerged after version 4 63 in 1993  but in later years a number of other ANSI editors appeared  some of which are still maintained today   The decline of both BBSes and DOS users has made it difficult for many users to even view ANSI animations  As a consequence  this form of art is no longer practiced to the degree it once was     File Zzt png thumb right 250px Entry ANSI art screen for   ZZT      The popular game creation system  GCS      ZZT     used ANSI graphics exclusively  A later GCS based on the same concept      MegaZeux      allowed users to modify the extended ASCII character set as well     Trade Wars 2002    a multiplayer BBS game that remains popular 20 years after its release in 1986  used ANSI graphics to depict ships  planets  and important locations  and included cutscenes and even a cinema with ANSI animations   Many of these ANSI graphics were created by Drew Markham  who went on to form   Xatrix     Gray Matter Interactive   and develop     Redneck Rampage     and     Return to Castle Wolfenstein      among other titles     Dwarf Fortress   is another game  first released in 2002  leveraging ANSI graphics  Dwarf Fortress  default graphics is

509|ARM9|   ARM9    is an   ARM architecture     32 bit     Reduced instruction set computer RISC     Central processing unit CPU   family   With this design generation  ARM moved from a   von Neumann architecture    Princeton architecture  to a   Harvard architecture   with separate instruction and   bus  computing  data buses    and caches   significantly increasing its potential speed   Most silicon chips integrating these cores will package them as   modified Harvard architecture   chips  combining the two address busses on the other side of separated   CPU caches   and tightly coupled memories   There are two subfamilies  implementing different ARM architecture versions     Differences from ARM7 cores   Key improvements over   ARM7   cores  enabled by spending more transistors  include ref  Performance of the ARM9TDMI and ARM9E S cores compared to the ARM7TDMI core   Issue 1 0  dated 9 February 2000  ARM Ltd   ref     Decreased heat production and lower overheating risk    Clock frequency improvements   Shifting from a three stage pipeline to a five stage one lets the clock speed be approximately doubled  on the same silicon fabrication process    Cycle count improvements   Many unmodified ARM7 binaries were measured as taking about 30  fewer cycles to execute on ARM9 cores   Key improvements include    Faster loads and stores  many instructions now cost just one cycle   This is helped by both the modified Harvard architecture  reducing bus and cache contention  and the new pipeline stages     Exposing pipeline interlocks  enabling compiler optimizations to reduce blockage between stages  Additionally  some ARM9 cores incorporate  Enhanced DSP  instructions  such as a multiply accumulate  to support more efficient implementations of   digital signal processing   algorithms   Switching to a Harvard architecture entailed a non unified cache  so that instruction fetches do not evict data  and vice versa    ARM9 cores have separate data and address bus signals  which chip designers use in various ways   In most cases they connect at least part of the address space in von Neumann style  used for both instructions and data  usually to an   Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture Advanced High performance Bus  28AHB 29 AHB   interconnect connecting to a   DRAM   interface and an   External Bus Interface   usable with   NOR flash   memory   Such hybrids are no longer pure Harvard architecture processors     ARM9TDMI based cores   ARM9TDMI is a successor to the popular ARM7TDMI core  and is also based on the ARMv4T architecture   Cores based on it support both 32 bit ARM and 16 bit Thumb instruction sets include    ARM920T with 16KB each of I D cache and an   Memory management unit MMU     ARM922T with 8KB each of I D cache and an MMU   ARM940T with cache and a Memory Protection Unit  MPU     ARM9E based cores   ARM9E  and its ARM9EJ sibling  implement longer pipelines and the ARMv5TE architecture  which includes some DSP ish instruction set extensions   They support 32 bit  16 bit  and sometimes 8 bit instruction sets    ARM926EJ S  includes ARM   Jazelle   technology which enables the direct

537|AS2|  for ActionScript version 2  programming language used with   Adobe Flash    ActionScript        AS2     Applicability Statement 2  is a   specification   about how to transport data securely and reliably over the   Internet    Security is achieved by using   digital certificate  s and   encryption        AS2 Technical Overview     The AS2 protocol is based on   HTTP   and   S MIME    It was the second AS protocol developed and uses the same signing  encryption and   Return receipt Message Disposition Notifications MDN    as defined by  http   www ietf org rfc rfc3798 txt RFC3798   conventions used in the original   AS1  networking  AS1   protocol  In other words    Files are encoded as  attachments  in a standardized   S MIME   message  an AS2 message     AS2 messages are always sent using the   HTTP   or   HTTPS   protocol    Secure Sockets Layer     also known as SSL   is implied by HTTPS  and usually use the  POST  method  use of  GET  is rare     Messages can be signed  but do not have to be    Messages can be encrypted  but do not have to be    Messages may request a Message Disposition Notification  MDN  back if all went well  but do not have to request such a message    If the original AS2 message requested an MDN     Upon the receipt of the message and its successful decryption or signature validation  as necessary  a  success  MDN will be sent back to the original sender  This MDN is typically signed but never encrypted  unless temporarily encrypted in transit via HTTPS       Upon the receipt and successful verification of the signature on the MDN  the original sender will  know  that the recipient got their message  this provides the  Non repudiation  element of AS2     If there are any problems receiving or interpreting the original AS2 message  a  failed  MDN may be sent back  However  part of the AS2 protocol states that the client must treat a lack of an MDN as a failure as well  so some AS2 receivers will simply not return an MDN in this case    Like any other AS file transfer  AS2 file transfers typically require both sides of the exchange to trade SSL certificates and specific  trading partner  names before any transfers can take place  AS2 trading partner names can usually be any valid phrase       MDN Options      Unlike AS1 or   AS3  networking  AS3   file transfers  AS2 file transfers offer several  MDN return  options instead of the traditional options of  yes  or  no   Specifically  the choices are       AS2 w   Sync  MDNs       Return Synchronous MDN via HTTP S    AS2 Sync       This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message sender clients over the same HTTP connection they used to send the original message  This  MDN while you wait  capability makes  AS2 Sync  transfers the fastest of any type of AS file transfer  but it also keeps this flavor of MDN request from being used with large files  which may   time out  telecommunication  time out   in low   Bandwidth  computing  bandwidth   situations         AS2 w   ASync  MDNs       Return Asynchronous MDN via HTTP S   a k a   AS2 Async       This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to the AS2 message sender s server later over a different HTTP connection  This flavor of MDN request is usually used if large files are involved        AS2 w   Email  MDNs       Return  Asynchronous  MDN via Email     This rarely used option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message senders via   email   rather than HTTP  Otherwise  it is similar to  AS2 Async  HTTP         AS2 w  No MDNs       Do not return MDN     This option works like it does in any other AS protocol  the receiver of an AS2 message with this option set simply does not try to return an MDN to the AS2 message sender      AS2 FileName Preserve       AS2 filename preservation feature will be used to communicate the filename to the trading partner  The banking industry relies on filenames being communicated between trading partners  AS2 vendors are currently certifying that implementation of filename communication conforms to the standard and is interoperable   There are two profiles for filename preservation being optionally tested under AS2 testing    Filename preservation without MDN responses   Filename preservation with an associated MDN response certification    External links      http   www ietf org rfc rfc4130 txt AS2

because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks  Also  to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users  bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners  making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk  ASCII art was also used in early e

 This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC  The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style  Oldskool   That term was introduced on the PC  When and by whom is unknown and lost in history   The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file  which included all the artwork  usually requested   with some design parts in between  as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a   ZIP archive   with separate text files for each piece  Furthermore  the releases were usually

its name  the style is not  new   on the contrary  it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by  Oldskool  and  Block  style ASCII art  It was dubbed  Newskool  upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s  ref name  asciistyles      Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of   Character encoding extended proprietary characters    The classic 7 bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant  but the extended characters are often used for  fine tuning  and  tweaking   The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of   Unicode       Methods for generating ASCII art     Main List of text editors ASCII and ANSI art    While some prefer to use a simple   text editor   to produce ASCII art  specialized programs have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors  For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor  because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard   The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard  Popular MS DOS based editors  such as TheDraw and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts  PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP      Image to text conversion      Main ASCII art converters    Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters  which is a special case of   vector quantization    A method is to sample the image down to   grayscale   with less than   integer  computer science  8 bit   precision  and then assign a character for each value   Examples of converted images are given below   This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art  dating back to the early days of the 1960s   minicomputer  s and   teletype  s  During the 1970s it was popular in   shopping mall malls   to get a   t shirt   with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer  With the advent of the web and   HTML   and   Cascading Style Sheets CSS    many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full   RGB   colorspace  enabling colorized ASCII images   Since the appearance of the first simple converter tools  individuals have converted images to ASCII art automatically and afterwards claimed that they generated the result themselves  by hand  via a text editor   Images that were converted to text  where no touch up work was done after the conversion  can in almost every case be identified as such  at least by an experienced text artist  The detection of converted  software generated text art becomes much more difficult if some time was spent by the editor to touch up the details that are typical indicators of auto generation   The inconsistencies in  shading  in just one art piece are often what gives the software created status away    center             Image Redwingblackbird1 jpg

using a   monospace font    where all characters are identical in width    Courier  typeface  Courier New   is a popular monospace font   Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays  Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors  web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts  such as   Arial   or   Times New Roman    where different widths are used for different characters  ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted  or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font   Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts  These ASCIIs  rather than using a purely shade based correspondence  use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading  These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed width ASCIIs for a lower character count  although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font specific     Animated ASCII art   Animated ASCII art started in 1970  from so called VT100 animations produced on   vt100   terminals  These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions  deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated  Usually  they represented a long hand crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story   Contemporary   web browser   revitalized animated ASCII art again  It became possible to display animated ASCII art via   JavaScript   or   Java  Sun  Java applets    Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another  creating the animation  very similar to how movie projectors  unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters  A new term was born    ASCIImation     another name of Animated ASCII Art  A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation  ref   cite web     first Simon     last Jansen     date April 18  2006

drawing characters or   pseudo graphics        ANSI art      Main ANSI art   The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character  It supports a variety of configurations  but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages    Code page 437   by default   16 foreground colors  8 background colors  and a flash option  Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly  ANSI SYS  if loaded  also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color flash changes  If this method is used then the art becomes known as   ANSI art    The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets  Plain text files are also seen with these characters  though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors  using the   Windows ANSI code page    have largely replaced DOS based ones      Shift JIS      File Mona01 svg thumb   nihongo    Mon         Mon    Posted on   nihongo      2ch             Nichanneru   in 2000     Main Shift JIS art   A large character selection and the availability of fixed width characters allow Japanese users to use   Shift JIS   as a text based art on Japanese websites      Unicode      Main Unicode     Unicode   would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters  However  finding a suitable fixed width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired   Modern UNIX style operating systems do provide complete fixed width Unicode fonts  e g  for   xterm    Windows has the   Courier New   font which includes characters like                   Also  the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used      Overprinting  surprint     In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting  mdash  the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters  as well as the choice of character  printed in a particular place  Thanks to the increased granularity of tone  photographs were often converted to this type of printout  Even manual typewriters or   daisy wheel printer  s could be used  The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs  and a normal text file  or an e mail message or Usenet posting  cannot represent overprinted text  However  something similar has emerged to replace it  shaded or colored ASCII art  using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes  such as those found in   HTML      Internet Relay Chat IRC    and many internet   message board  s  to add a bit more tone variation  In this way  it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color    ASCII art programs       List of text editors ASCII and ANSI art ASCII art text editors      See also     Commons category       Fax art     Types and Styles

bank of identically capable processing units  This differs greatly from past generations PC graphics chips that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task  vertex fragment   Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware   tessellation Tessellations and computer graphics surface tessellation   to divide a surface into smaller triangles  similar to   TruForm   in terms of functionality  which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the most up to date   Direct3D Direct3D 10 DirectX 10   specification  The recent generation   Radeon R600   GPU core

690|Ablative case|  about  the physical process Ablation the spacecraft technology Ablative armor    In   linguistics       ablative case       list of glossing abbreviations abbreviated     sc    abl       is a name given to   grammatical case cases   in various languages whose common characteristic is that they mark motion away from something  though the details in each language may differ  The name  ablative  is derived from the   Latin     ablatus    the  irregular  perfect passive participle of   auferre    to carry away      Indo European languages      Latin      Main Ablative  Latin    The   Latin   ablative case    ablativus   is mainly used   adverb  ially to modify   verb  s  It has 15 uses  descending from three   Proto Indo European language Proto Indo European   cases  ablative  from   instrumental  with   and locative  in at   The ablative is sometimes called the   adverbial case    since phrases in the ablative can be translated as   adverb  s    magn   cum  celerit te   can be translated as  with great speed  or  very quickly       Greek    In   Ancient Greek    the functions of the ablative case were taken by the   genitive case genitive    so that the genitive has functions belonging to the   Proto Indo European language Proto Indo European   genitive and ablative cases  ref   Herbert Weir Smyth      Greek Grammar    par  1279  composite or mixed cases   ref  The genitive case with the prepositions       ap     away from  and         ek ex    out of  is an example      Albanian    The ablative case is found in Albanian where it is the fifth case and is called  m nyra rrjedhore       Sanskrit    The ablative case in Sanskrit is the fifth case  panchami  in the grammar  and has similar function to that of Latin     Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject  out of  which or  from  whom something  an action  an object  has arisen or occurred    E g    patram    vrikshaat    patati    the leaf falls    from the tree       This case is also used for nouns in several other senses  eg  where the action occurs  because of  or  without  a certain noun  nouns indicating distance or direction      Armenian    In the Western Armenian language  the ablative case is rendered by the suffix    e    indefinite  or    en    definite       Mart     man    Marten     from the man    Marte     from  a  man     Doon     house    D nen     from the house    D ne     from  a  house  In Eastern Armenian  the suffix    its   is used for both definite and indefinite nouns     Mard    man     Mardits    from man    Toon    house    T nits    from house  Both suffixes are derived from Classical Armenian  The Western suffix    e   is from the Classical singular and the Eastern suffix    its   is from the Classical plural  both have been generalized for singular and plural in the dialects that use them   In Armenian  the ablative case has several uses   Its principal function is to show motion away from a point in space or time      KAGHAKEN katsi        I came FROM THE CITY   Eastern Armenian     KAGHAKITS gnets        ASTEGHEN heroo g abrei        I used to live far FROM HERE    Ea     ASTEGHITS heroo ei b nakvoom      The case also shows the agent when used with the passive voice of the verb      INE misht g  sirveis        You were always loved BY ME     Ea    INDZITS misht eis sirvoom        AZAD CHNEREN azadetsank        We were freed BY THE LIBERATORS   Ea     AZATOGHNERITS azatfetsink      The ablative case is also important to comparative statements in colloquial Armenian      Inch MEGHREN anoosh eh         What is sweeter THAN HONEY    proverb     Ea     Inch MEGHRITS e anoosh         Mariam EKHPEREN b zdig eh        Mary is smaller  younger  THAN HER BROTHER    Ea     Maro AKHBERITS e bakas      In this use  the ablative can also be used with infinitives and participles       Tooz hamdesel e lav DESNALE        Figs are better to taste THAN TO SEE    Ea     T zner hamtesel e laf TESNELITS      The ablative case is also important to case government with postpositions      INE var        Below ME   Ea     INDZITS var        KEZME ver      Above YOU   Ea     KEZITS ver        ANONTSME verch     After THEM    Ea     N RANITS verj        MEZME arach      Before US    Ea     MEZNITS araj       Uralic languages      Finnish    In   Finnish language Finnish    the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning  from  off  of   e g    p yt    p yd lt     table   off from the table   It is an outer locative case  used just as the   adessive   and   allative   cases to denote both being on top of something and  being around the place   as opposed to the inner locative case  the   elative    which means  from out of  or  from the inside of    In the locative meaning  the receding object was near the other place or object  not inside it   The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions   The Finnish ablative has the ending  lta or  lt  according to the regular rules of   vowel harmony     Usage    away from a place    Katolta    Off the roof    P yd lt     Off the table    Rannalta    From the beach    Maalta    From the land    Merelt     From the sea    to stop some activity with the verb l hte     l hte  tupakalta    stop smoking  in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now  literally  leave from the tobacco     l hte  hippasilta    stop playing the game of tag  hippa tag  olla hippasilla playing tag     to smell taste feel look sound like something    haisee pahalta    smells bad   maistuu hyv lt     tastes good   tuntuu kamalalta    feels awful   n ytt   tyhm lt     looks stupid   kuulostaa mukavalta    sounds nice     Hungarian    The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe    movement away from a solid object      For example  if one is walking away from a friend one could say     a bar tom   t l    j v k     I am coming  away from  my friend   Note that this case in this example implies that the user was   next to   the solid object  and not inside it   This means that if one said   a post t l j v k   it would mean one is coming from being stood   next to   the post office  and that you were not inside the building    The application of   vowel harmony   gives two different suffixes       t l    and     t l      These are applied to back  and front vowel words respectively   Its partners for movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the   allative case   and the   adessive case   respectively    Its partners that correspond to movement away from  or out of  something are the   delative case    for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city  and the   elative case    for movement out of a container or from out of an international city      Altaic languages      Azeri     The ablative in   Azerbaijani language Azeri        Lang az   x  l q hal      is expressed through the suffixes    dan   or    d n    Examples   Ev   ev   d n     br   House   from off the house    Aparmaq   aparmaq   dan     br   To carry   from off carrying       Turkish

698|Aboutness|  Citation style      Aboutness    is a term used in library and information science  LIS   linguistics  philosophy of language  and philosophy of mind  In LIS  it is often considered synonymous with   subject  discourse     In philosophy it has been often considered synonymous with   intentionality    perhaps since   John Searle    1983     R  A  Fairthorne  1969  is credited with coining the exact term  aboutness   which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s  perhaps due to arguments put forward by   William John Hutchins    1975  1977  1978   Hutchins argued that  aboutness  was to be preferred to  subject  because it removed some epistemological problems  Hj rland  1992  1997  argued  however  that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins s proposal  why  aboutness  and  subject  should be considered synonymous    While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness  John Hutchins  1975  1977  1978

Irene Stegun   of the   United States U S      National Bureau of Standards    now the   National Institute of Standards and Technology      Its full title is      Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas  Graphs  and Mathematical Tables        Since it was first published in 1964  the 1046 page   Handbook   has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on   special function  s  containing definitions  identities  approximations  plots  and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of   applied mathematics     The notation used in the   Handbook   is the     de facto     standard for much of applied mathematics today   At the time of its publication  the   Handbook   was an essential resource for practitioners   Nowadays    computer algebra system  s have replaced the   mathematical table function tables    but the   Handbook   remains an important reference source   The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that    the advent of high speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables        cquote  More than 1 000 pages long  the   Handbook of Mathematical Functions   was first published in 1964 and reprinted many times  with yet another reprint in 1999  Its influence on science and engineering is evidenced by its popularity  In fact  when   New Scientist   magazine recently asked some of the world s leading scientists what single book they would want if stranded on a desert island  one distinguished British physicist ref   Michael Berry

likely the most widely distributed and most cited NIST technical publication of all time  Government sales exceed 150 000 copies  and an estimated three times as many have been reprinted and sold by commercial publishers since 1965  During the mid 1990s  the book was cited every 1 5 hours of each working day  And its influence will persist as it is currently being updated in digital format by

788|Access structure|   Access structures    are used in the study of security system where multiple parties need to work together to obtain a resource  Groups of parties that are granted access are called qualified  In   set theory set theoretic   terms they are referred to as qualified sets  In turn  the set of all such qualified sets is called the access structure of the system  Less formally it is a description of who needs to cooperate with whom in order to access the resource  In its original use in   cryptography    the resource was a secret   secret sharing shared   among the participants  Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure  are able to join their shares to recompute the secret  More generally  the resource can also be a task that a group of people can complete together  such as creating a   digital signature    or decrypting an encrypted message   It is reasonable to assume that access structures are   monotone   in the sense that  if a subset S is in the access structure  all sets that contain S as a subset should also form part of the access structure     See also        Access control       Secret sharing       Threshold cryptosystem      Category Access control       crypto stub

can be   access control controlled   by attaching a   security descriptor    but it is generally never done in practice   The access token is generated by the   login logon   service when a user logs

token  The token is attached to every process created by the user session  processes whose owner is the user   ref name  atoken    Whenever such a process accesses any resource which has   access

tokens   There are two types of tokens   Primary token  Primary tokens can only be associated to   Process  computing  processes    and they represent a process s security subject  The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations  requiring two different privileges in the name of   privilege separation     the typical scenario sees the

803|Accounting method|  dablink For accounting methods in business and financial reporting  see   Accounting methods      In the field of   analysis of algorithms   in   computer science    the    accounting method    is a method of   amortized analysis   based on   accounting     The accounting method often gives a more intuitive account of the amortized cost of an operation than either   aggregate analysis   or the   potential method     Note  however  that this does not guarantee such analysis will be immediately obvious  often  choosing the correct parameters for the accounting method requires as much knowledge of the problem and the complexity bounds one is attempting to prove as the other two methods   The accounting method is most naturally suited for proving a   Big O notation O   1  bound on time   The method as explained here is for proving such a bound     The method    Preliminarily  we choose a set of elementary operations which will be used in the   algorithm    and arbitrarily set their cost to 1   The fact that the costs of these operations may in reality differ presents no difficulty in principle   What is important  is that each elementary operation has a constant cost   Each aggregate operation is assigned a  payment    The payment is intended to cover the cost of elementary operations needed to complete this particular operation  with some of the payment left over  placed in a pool to be used later   The difficulty with problems that require amortized analysis is that  in general  some of the operations will require greater than constant cost   This means that no constant payment will be enough to cover the worst case cost of an operation  in and of itself   With proper selection of payment  however  this is no longer a difficulty  the expensive operations will only occur when there is sufficient payment in the pool to cover their costs     Examples    A few examples will help to illustrate the use of the accounting method      Table expansion     It is often necessary to create a table before it is known how much space is needed   One possible strategy is to double the size of the table when it is full   Here we will use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost of an insertion operation in such a table is   O   1    Before looking at the procedure in detail  we need some definitions   Let T be a table  E an element to insert  num T  the number of elements in T  and size T  the allocated size of T   We assume the existence of operations create table n   which creates an empty table of size n  for now assumed to be free  and elementary insert T E   which inserts element E into a table T that already has space allocated  with a cost of 1   The following   pseudocode   illustrates the table insertion procedure       function    table insert T E           if    num T    size T            U    create table 2  times  size T                for each    F    in    T               elementary insert U F            T    U       elementary insert T E   Without amortized analysis  the best bound we can show for n insert operations is O n sup 2  sup    mdash  this is due to the loop at line 4 that performs num T  elementary insertions   For analysis using the accounting method  we assign a payment of 3 to each table insertion   Although the reason for this is not clear now  it will become clear during the course of the analysis   Assume that initially the table is empty with size T    m   The first m insertions therefore do not require reallocation and only have cost 1  for the elementary insert    Therefore  when num T    m  the pool has  3   1  times m   2m   Inserting element m   1 requires reallocation of the table   Creating the new table on line 3 is free  for now    The loop on line 4 requires m elementary insertions  for a cost of m   Including the insertion on the last line  the total cost for this operation is m   1   After this operation  the pool therefore has 2m   3    m   1    m   2   Next  we add another m   1 elements to the table   At this point the pool has m   2   2 times  m   1    3m   Inserting an additional element  that is  element 2m   1  can be seen to have cost 2m   1 and a payment of 3   After this operation  the pool has 3m   3    2m   1    m   2   Note that this is the same amount as after inserting element m   1   In fact  we can show that this will be the case for any number of reallocations   It can now be made clear why the payment for an insertion is 3   1 goes to inserting the element the first time it is added to the table  1 goes to moving it the next time the table is expanded  and 1 goes to moving one of the elements that was already in the table the next time the table is expanded   We initially assumed that creating a table was free   In reality  creating a table of size n may be as expensive as O n    Let us say that the cost of creating a table of size n is n   Does this new cost present a difficulty   Not really  it turns out we use the same method to show the amortized O 1  bounds   All we have to do is change the payment   When a new table is created  there is an old table with m entries   The new table will be of size 2m   As long as the entries currently in the table have added enough to the pool to pay for creating the new table  we will be all right   We cannot expect the first  math  frac m  2   math  entries to help pay for the new table   Those entries already paid for the current table   We must then rely on the last  math  frac m  2   math  entries to pay the cost  math 2m  math    This means we must add  math  frac 2m  m 2    4  math  to the payment for each entry  for a total payment of 3   4   7      References         Thomas H  Cormen      Charles E  Leiserson      Ronald L  Rivest    and

808|Accuracy paradox|  Refimprove date December 2009   The    accuracy paradox    for   predictive analytics   states that predictive models with a given level of   accuracy   may have greater   predictive power   than models with higher accuracy  It may be better to avoid the accuracy metric in favor of other metrics such as   Accuracy and precision precision   and   Recall  information retrieval  recall        Accuracy is often the starting point for analyzing the quality of a predictive model  as well as an obvious criterion for prediction  Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of cases evaluated  It may seem obvious that the ratio of correct predictions to cases should be a key metric  A predictive model may have high accuracy  but be useless   In an example predictive model for an   insurance fraud   application  all cases that are predicted as high risk by the model will be investigated  To evaluate the performance of the model  the insurance company has created a sample data set of 10 000 claims  All 10 000 cases in the   validation   sample have been carefully checked and it is known which cases are fraudulent  To analyze the quality of the model  the insurance uses the   table of confusion     The definition of accuracy  the table of confusion for model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup   and the calculation of accuracy for model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup  is shown below    math  mathrm A  M     frac TN   TP  TN   FP   FN   TP   math  where   TN is the number of true negative cases   FP is the number of false positive cases   FN is the number of false negative cases   TP is the number of true positive cases    Formula 1  Definition of Accuracy      class  prettytable     Predicted Negative  Predicted Positive     Negative Cases  9 700  150     Positive Cases  50  100       Table 1  Table of Confusion for Fraud Model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup       math  mathrm A  M     frac 9 700   100  9 700   150   50   100    98 0   math     Formula 2  Accuracy for model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup     With an accuracy of 98 0  model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup  appears to perform fairly well  The paradox lies in the fact that accuracy can be easily improved to 98 5  by always predicting  no fraud   The table of confusion and the accuracy for this trivial  always predict negative  model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup  and the accuracy of this model are shown below     class  prettytable     Predicted Negative  Predicted Positive     Negative Cases  9 850  0     Positive Cases  150  0       Table 2  Table of Confusion for Fraud Model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup       math  mathrm A  M     frac 9 850   0  9 850   150   0   0    98 5   math     Formula 3  Accuracy for model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup     Model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup reduces the rate of inaccurate predictions from 2  to 1 5   This is an apparent improvement of 25   The new model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup  shows fewer incorrect predictions and markedly improved accuracy  as compared to the original model M sub 1  sub  sup Fraud  sup   but is obviously useless    The alternative model M sub 2  sub  sup Fraud  sup  does not offer any value to the company for preventing fraud  The less accurate model is more useful than the more accurate model     Model improvements should not be measured in terms of accuracy gains  It may be going too far to say that accuracy is irrelevant  but caution is advised when using accuracy in the evaluation of predictive models     See also      Receiver operating characteristic   for other measures of how good model predictions are     Bibliography     refbegin       citation  last Zhu  first Xingquan  title Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Challenges and Realities  publisher IGI Global   url http   books google com  id zdJQAAAAMAAJ q data mining challenges and realities dq data mining challenges and realities  year 2007  isbn 9781599042527  pages 118 119        doi 10 1117 12 785623     pp 86 87 of  http   www utwente nl ewi trese graduation projects 2009 Abma pdf this Master s thesis    refend      Category Statistical paradoxes     Category Machine learning     Category Data mining

define the function   f      n        A     n      n     which increases both   m   and   n   at the same time  we have a function of one variable that dwarfs every primitive recursive function  including very fast growing functions such as the   exponential function    the factorial function  multi  and   superfactorial   functions  and even functions defined using Knuth s up arrow notation  except when the indexed up arrow is used    This extreme growth can be exploited to show that   f    which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a   Turing machine   and so is a   computable function    grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive   In a category with exponentials  using the isomorphism  math A  times B  rightarrow C  cong A  rightarrow  B  rightarrow C   math   in computer science  this is called   currying     the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher order functionals as follows     math   begin array  lcl   operatorname Ack  0         operatorname Succ      operatorname Ack  m 1         operatorname Iter   operatorname Ack  m    end array    math   where   Succ   is the usual   successor function   and   Iter   is defined by primitive recursion as well     math   begin array  lcl   operatorname Iter  f  0        f 1      operatorname Iter  f  n 1        f  operatorname Iter  f  n     end array    math   One interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1  Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion  This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output  and so is also extremely huge  In actuality  for most cases the running time is far larger than the output  see below     Table of values   Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table  We place the natural numbers along the top row  To determine a number in the table  take the number immediately to the left  then look up the required number in the previous row  at the position given by the number just taken  If there is no number to its left  simply look at the column headed  1  in the previous row  Here is a small upper left portion of the table      class  wikitable     Values of   A     m      n           m

be easily notated in some other form   Despite the large values occurring in this early section of the table  some even larger numbers have been defined  such as   Graham s number    which cannot be written with any small number of   Knuth s up arrow notation Knuth arrows    This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively   This is a repeat of the above table  but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly      class  wikitable     Values of   A     m      n

set data structure   and   Bernard Chazelle Chazelle   s algorithm for   minimum spanning tree  s  Sometimes Ackermann s original function or other variations are used in these settings  but they all grow at similarly high rates  In particular  some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the    3   and similar terms   A two parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows  where  math  lfloor x  rfloor  math  is the   floor function      math  alpha m n     min  i  geq 1   A i  lfloor m n  rfloor   geq  log 2 n     math  This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above  and gives a more refined time bound  In the disjoint set data structure    m   represents the number of operations while   n   represents the number of elements  in the minimum spanning tree algorithm    m   represents the number of edges while   n   represents the number of vertices  Several slightly different definitions of     m      n    exist  for example  log sub 2  sub    n   is sometimes replaced by   n    and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a   ceiling function ceiling     Other studies might define an inverse

a compiler which  in analyzing the computation of   A   3  30   is able to save intermediate values like   A   3    n    and   A   2    n    in that calculation rather than recomputing them  can speed

897|Activity diagram|  Image Activity conducting svg thumb upright 2 UML 1 x Activity diagram for a guided   brainstorming     process         Activity diagrams    are graphical representations of   workflow  s of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice  iteration and concurrency  ref  http   highered mcgraw hill com sites 0077110005 student view0 glossary html Glossary of Key Terms  at McGraw hill com  Retrieved 20 July 2008   ref  In the   Unified Modeling Language    activity diagrams can be used to describe the business and operational step by step   workflow  s of components in a system  An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control      Construction    Activity diagrams are constructed from a limited repertoire of shapes  connected with arrows   The most important shape types      rounded rectangles   represent   activities        diamonds   represent   decisions        bars   represent the start    split    or end    join    of concurrent activities    a   black circle   represents the start    initial state    of the workflow    an   encircled black circle   represents the end    final state     Arrows run from the start towards the end and represent the order in which activities happen   Hence they can be regarded as a form of   flowchart     Typical flowchart techniques lack constructs for expressing concurrency   However  the join and split symbols in activity diagrams only resolve this for simple cases  the meaning of the model is not clear when they are arbitrarily combined with decisions or loops   While in UML 1 x  activity diagrams were a specialized form of state diagrams  in UML 2 x  the activity diagrams were reformalized to be based on   Petri net   like semantics  increasing the scope of situations that can be modeled using activity diagrams  These changes cause many UML 1 x activity diagrams to be interpreted differently in UML 2 x        Applications       In   Systems Modeling Language SysML   the activity diagram has been extended to indicate flows among steps that convey physical matter  e g   gasoline  or energy  e g   torque  pressure   Additional changes allow the diagram to better support continuous behaviors and continuous data flows      Alternatives    In UML 1 x  an alternative to activity diagrams is the   State diagram UML state diagram UML State diagram    in which states can be used to represent activities  namely the state of that activity being performed   and transitions represent the start or completion of activities   This mapping of activity diagram features to state diagram were formalized in UML 1 x  leaving activity diagrams little more that the use of state machines to capture behavior and partially concurrent behavior within a work flow   Despite the  small  advantages of using UML 1 x activity diagram over state machines  such as the ability to cover the behaviors of collaborating elements  while state machines are limited to a single element  many modelers continued using state diagrams  State machines were attractive to use as the states may also represent conditions that hold before or after the activities  Activity diagrams and state diagram had similar abilities to express concurrency  though the run to completion  RTC  semantics of State machines limited the expressiveness of the concurrency     Perhaps the most important reason why state machines were more popular in UML 1 x over activity diagrams was that the tool vendors were slow to implement robust activity diagram capabilities        With UML 2 x  the foundation of activity

898|Activity recognition|   Activity recognition    aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents  actions and the environmental conditions  Since the 1980s  this research field has captured the attention of several   computer science   communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine  human computer interaction  or sociology   To understand activity recognition better  consider the following scenario  An elderly man wakes up at dawn in his small studio apartment  where he stays alone  He lights the stove to make a pot of tea  switches on the toaster oven  and takes some bread and jelly from the cupboard  After taking his morning medication  a computer generated voice gently reminds him to turn off the toaster  Later that day  his daughter accesses a secure website where she scans a check list  which was created by a sensor network in her father s apartment  She finds that her father is eating normally  taking his medicine on schedule  and continuing to manage his daily life on his own  That information puts her mind at ease   Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity recognition  examples include assisting the sick and disabled  For example  Pollack et al  ref Pollack  M E   and et al   L  E  B  2003   Autominder  an intelligent cognitive orthotic system for people with memory impairment     Robotics and Autonomous Systems   44 3 4  273 282   ref  show that by automatically monitoring human activities  home based rehabilitation can be provided for people suffering from traumatic brain injuries  One can find applications ranging from security related applications and logistics support to location based services  Due to its many faceted nature  different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition  goal recognition  intent recognition  behavior recognition  location estimation and location based services     Types of activity recognition      Sensor based  single user activity recognition      Sensor   based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel   data mining   and   machine learning   techniques to model a wide range of human activities  ref Tanzeem Choudhury  Gaetano Borriello  et al  The Mobile Sensing Platform  An Embedded System for Activity Recognition  Appears in the IEEE Pervasive Magazine   Special Issue on Activity Based Computing  April 2008   ref  Mobile devices  e g  smart phones  provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life  Sensor based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering   ubiquitous computing ubiquitous computers   and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents  under consent   these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf       Levels of sensor based activity recognition     Sensor based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input  Thus    statistical modeling   has been the main thrust in this direction in layers  where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected  At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected  statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data  At an intermediate level    statistical inference   may be concerned about how to recognize individuals  activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels  Furthermore  at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning  Scientific conferences where activity recognition work from wearable and environmental often appears are   ISWC   and   UbiComp        Sensor based  multi user activity recognition    Recognizing activities for multiple users using on body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems  ref Want R   Hopper A   Falcao V   Gibbons J   The Active Badge Location System  ACM Transactions on Information  Systems  Vol  40  No  1  pp  91 102  January 1992  ref  in the early 90 s  Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios  ref Bieber G   Kirste T   Untersuchung des

addressed in Gu et al  ref Tao Gu  Zhanqing Wu  Liang Wang  Xianping Tao  and Jian Lu  Mining Emerging Patterns for Recognizing Activities of Multiple Users in Pervasive Computing  In Proc  of the 6th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems  Computing  Networking and Services  MobiQuitous  09   Toronto  Canada  July 13 16  2009   ref  In this work  they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment  and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single user and multi user activities in a unified solution  Many interesting research topics can be spawn from this work      Vision based activity recognition    It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras  The primary technique employed is computer vision  Vision based activity recognition has found many applications such as human computer interaction  user interface design  robot learning  and surveillance  among others  Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are   ICCV   and   CVPR     In vision based activity recognition  a great deal of work has been done  Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as   optical flow      Kalman filtering    hidden   Markov model  s  etc   under different modalities such as single camera  stereo  and infrared  In addition  researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic  including single pedestrian tracking  group tracking  and detecting dropped objects       Levels of vision based activity recognition     In vision based activity recognition  the computational process is often divided into four steps  namely human detection  human tracking  human activity recognition and then a high level activity evaluation     Approaches of activity recognition      Activity recognition through logic and reasoning    Logic based approaches keep track of all   logically consistent   explanations of the observed actions  Thus  all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered  Kautz ref H  Kautz   A formal theory of plan recognition   In PhD thesis  University of Rochester  1987   ref  provided a formal theory of plan recognition  He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription  All actions  plans are uniformly referred to as goals  and a recognizer s knowledge is represented by a set of first order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first order logic  which defines abstraction  decomposition and functional relationships between types of events   Kautz s general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case  measured in the size of input hierarchy  Lesh and Etzioni ref N  Lesh and O  Etzioni   A sound and fast goal recognizer   In   Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence    1995   ref  went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally  In contrast to Kautz s approach where the plan library is explicitly represented  Lesh and Etzioni s approach enables automatic plan library construction from domain primitives  Furthermore  they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries   Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive  Besides  they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual s recent behavior  Pollack et al  described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description   A serious problem of logic based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty  They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another  as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed  There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods      Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning    Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions  plans and goals   Plan recognition can be done as a process of reasoning under uncertainty  which is convincingly argued by Charniak and Goldman  ref E  Charniak and R P  Goldman   A Bayesian model of plan recognition     Artificial Intelligence    64 53 79  1993   ref  They argued that any model that does not incorporate some theory of uncertainty reasoning cannot be adequate  In the literature  there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent s plans and goals

problem  They proposed a novel data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential  interleaved

unified computation framework  Secondly  no training is required for interleaved and concurrent activities since these two activity models can be derived directly from the sequential activity model  Thirdly  their solution is more noise tolerant because mining the differences of classes will not include noise patterns provided the noise distribution is random among classes  The noise tolerant feature is particularly important in sensor based activity recognition     Labs in the world      http   www eecs umich edu  pollackm  Martha Pollack s research group     http   www cse ust hk  qyang

908|Actor model and process calculi|  Copy to Wikibooks    In   computer science    the      Actor model      and   Process calculi    process calculi      are two closely related approaches to the modelling of   concurrency  computer science  concurrent digital computation     See   Actor model and process calculi history     There are many similarities between the two approaches  but also several differences  some philosophical  some technical    There is only one   Actor model    although it has numerous formal systems for design  analysis  verification  modeling    etc      there are numerous   process calculi    developed for reasoning about a variety of different kinds of concurrent systems at various levels of detail  including calculi that incorporate time  stochastic transitions  or constructs specific to application areas such as security analysis    The Actor model was inspired by the laws of   physics   and depends on them for its fundamental axioms    i e      physical law  s  see   Actor model theory     the process calculi were originally inspired by   algebra     harv Milner 1993      Processes in the process calculi are anonymous  and communicate by sending messages either through named   Channel  communications  channels    synchronous or asynchronous   or via   Ambient calculus ambients    which can also be used to model channel like communications   harv Cardelli and Gordon 1998     In contrast  actors in the Actor model possess an identity  and communicate by sending messages to the mailing addresses of other actors  this style of communication can also be used to model channel like communications  mdash  see below        The publications on the Actor model and on process calculi have a fair number of cross references  acknowledgments  and reciprocal citations  see   Actor model and process calculi history        How do channels work    Indirect communication using channels    e g    Gilles Kahn and David MacQueen  1977   has been an important issue for communication in parallel and concurrent computation affecting both semantics and performance   Some process calculi differ from the Actor model in their use of channels as opposed to direct communication     Issues with synchronous channels   Synchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel must wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel before the sender can proceed      Simple synchronous channels     A synchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives  tt put  tt  and  tt get  tt  communications   The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple synchronous channel   Each  tt put  tt  communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent when the message is received by a  tt get  tt  communication from the channel in   FIFO   order   Each  tt get  tt   communication has an address to which the received message is sent      Synchronous channels in process calculi     However  simple synchronous channels do not suffice for process calculi such as   Communicating Sequential Processes    CSP   Hoare 1978 and 1985  because use of the   guarded choice    after Dijkstra  command  called the   alternative   command in CSP    In a guarded choice command multiple offers  called guards  can be made concurrently on multiple channels to  tt put  tt  and  tt get  tt  messages  however at most one of the guards can be chosen for each execution of the guarded choice command   Because only one guard can be chosen  a guarded choice command in general effectively requires a kind of   two phase commit protocol   or perhaps even a   three phase commit protocol   if   Timeout  telecommunication  time outs   are allowed in guards  as in Occam 3  1992     Consider the following program written in CSP  Hoare 1978     X    Z stop        Y    guard  boolean  guard    true          guard     Z go    Z guard       Z    n  integer  n   0            X stop       Y false  print n               Y go       n    n 1  Y true     According to Clinger  1981   this program illustrates global nondeterminism  since the nondeterminism arises from incomplete specification of the timing of signals between the three processes  tt X  tt    tt Y  tt   and  tt Z  tt    The repetitive guarded command in the definition of  tt Z  tt  has two alternatives     the  tt stop  tt  message is accepted from  tt X  tt   in which case  tt Y  tt  is sent the value    false    and  tt print  tt  is sent the value  tt n  tt   a  tt go  tt  message is accepted from  tt Y  tt   in which case  tt n  tt  is incremented and  tt Y  tt  is sent the value    true     If  tt Z  tt  ever accepts the  tt stop  tt  message from  tt X  tt   then  tt X  tt  terminates   Accepting the  tt stop  tt  causes  tt Y  tt  to be sent    false    which when input as the value of its guard will cause  tt Y  tt  to terminate   When both  tt X  tt  and  tt Y  tt  have terminated   tt Z  tt  terminates because it no longer has live processes providing input   In the above program  there are synchronous channels from  tt X  tt  to  tt Z  tt    tt Y  tt  to  tt Z  tt   and  tt Z  tt  to  tt Y  tt       Analogy with the committee coordination problem    According to Knabe  1992   Chandy and Misra  1988  characterized this as analogous to the committee coordination problem    Professors in a university are assigned to various committees   Occasionally a professor will decide to attend a meeting of any of her committees  and will wait until that is possible   Meetings may begin only if there is full attendance   The task is to ensure that if all the members of a committee are waiting  then at least one of them will attend some meeting   The crux of this problem is that two or more committees might share a professor   When that professor becomes available  she can only choose one of the meetings  while the others continue to wait      A simple distributed protocol    This section presents a simple distributed protocol for channels in synchronous process calculi   The protocol has some problems that are addressed in the sections below   The behavior of a guarded choice command is as follows   The command sends a message to each of its guards to  tt prepare  tt    When it receives the first response from one of its guards that it is prepared  then it sends a message to that guard to  tt prepare to commit  tt  and sends messages to all of the other guards to  tt abort  tt     When it receives a message from the guard that it is  tt prepared to commit  tt   then it sends the guard a  tt commit  tt  message  However  if the guard throws an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to commit  tt   then guarded choice command starts the whole process all over again   If all of its guards respond that they cannot  tt prepare  tt   then the guarded command does nothing   The behavior of a guard is as follows   When a message to  tt prepare  tt  is received  then the guard sends a  tt prepare  tt  message to each of the channels with which it is offering to communicate   If the guard has booleans such that it cannot  tt prepare tt  or if any of the channels respond that they cannot  tt prepare  tt   then it sends  tt abort  tt  messages to the other channels and then responds that it cannot  tt prepare  tt     When a message to  tt prepare to commit  tt  is received  then the guard sends a  tt prepare to commit  tt  message to each of the channels  If any of the channels respond that they cannot  tt prepare to commit  tt   then it sends  tt abort  tt  messages to the other channels and then throws an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to commit  tt     When a message to  tt commit  tt  is received  then the guard sends an  tt commit  tt  message to each of the channels    When a message to  tt abort  tt  is received  then the guard sends an  tt abort  tt  message to each of the channels   The behavior of a channel is as follows   When a  tt prepare to put  tt  communication is received  then respond that it is prepared if there is a  tt prepare to get tt  communication pending unless a  tt terminate  tt  communication has been received  in which case throw an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to put  tt    When a  tt prepare to get  tt  communication is received  then respond that it is prepared if there is a  tt prepare to put tt  communication pending unless a  tt terminate  tt  communication has been received  in which case throw an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to get  tt     When a  tt prepare to commit to put  tt  communication is received  then respond that it is prepared if there is a  tt prepare to commit to get tt  communication pending unless a  tt terminate  tt  communication has been received  in which case throw an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to commit to put  tt     When a  tt prepare to commit to get  tt  communication is received  then respond that it is prepared if there is a  tt prepare to commit to put tt  communication pending unless a  tt terminate  tt  communication has been received  in which case throw an exception that it cannot  tt prepare to commit to get  tt      When a  tt commit put tt  communication is received  then depending on which of the following is received      When a  tt commit get tt  communication is received  then if not already done perform the  tt put  tt  and  tt get  tt  and clean up the preparations      When an  tt abort get tt  communication is received  then cancel the preparations    When a  tt commit get tt  communication is received  then depending on which of the following is received      When a  tt commit put tt  communication is received  then if not already done perform the  tt get  tt  and  tt put  tt  and clean up the preparations      When an  tt abort put tt  communication is received  then cancel the preparations     When an  tt abort put tt  communication is received  then cancel the preparations     When an  tt abort get tt  communication is received  then cancel the preparations      Starvation on getting from multiple channels    Again consider the program written in CSP  discussed in   Actor model and process calculi Synchronous channels in process calculi Synchronous channels in process calculi   above     X    Z stop        Y    guard  boolean  guard    true          guard     Z go    Z guard       Z    n  integer  n   0            X stop       Y false  print n               Y go       n    n 1  Y true      As pointed out in Knabe  1992   a problem with the above protocol    Actor model and process calculi A simple distributed protocol A simple distributed protocol    is that the process  tt Z  tt  might never accept the  tt stop  tt  message from  tt X  tt   a phenomenon called   Resource starvation starvation    and consequently the above program might never print anything   In contrast consider  a simple Actor system that consists of Actors    X        Y        Z     and    print    where   the Actor    X    is created with the following behavior    If the message  tt  start   tt  is received  then send    Z    the message   tt  stop   tt    the Actor    Y    is created with the following behavior    If the message  tt  start   tt  is received  then send    Z    the message   tt  go   tt    If the message    true    is received  then send    Z    the message   tt  go   tt    If the message    false    is received  then do nothing   the Actor    Z    is created with the following behavior that has a count  tt n  tt  that is initially    0       If the message  tt  start   tt  is received  then do nothing    If the message  tt  stop   tt  is received  then send    Y    the message    false    and send    print    the message the count  tt n  tt     If the message  tt  go   tt  is received  then send    Y    the message    true    and process the next message received with count  tt n  tt  being  tt n 1  tt    By the laws of Actor semantics  the above Actor system will always halt when the Actors    X        Y     are    Z    are each sent a  tt  start   tt  message resulting in sending    print    a number that can be unbounded large   The difference between the CSP program and the Actor system is that the Actor    Z    does not get messages using a guarded choice command from multiple channels   Instead it processes messages in arrival ordering  and by the laws for Actor systems  the  tt stop  tt  message is guaranteed to arrive      Livelock on getting from multiple channels    Consider the following program written in CSP   Hoare 1978     Bidder1    b  bid            Bids1 b     process1 b               Bids2 b     process1 b        Bidder2    b  bid            Bids1 b     process2 b               Bids2 b     process2 b        As pointed out in Knabe  1992   an issue with the above protocol    Actor model and process calculi A simple distributed protocol A simple distributed protocol    is that the process  tt Bidder2  tt  might never accept a bid from  tt Bid1  tt  or  tt Bid2  tt   a phenomenon called   livelock    and consequently  tt process2  tt  might never be sent anything   In each attempt to accept a message   tt Bidder2  tt  is thwarted because the bid that was offered by  tt Bids1  tt  or  tt Bids2  tt  is snatched away by  tt Bidder1  tt  because it turns out that  tt Bidder1  tt  has much faster access than  tt Bidder2  tt  to  tt Bids1  tt  and  tt Bids2 tt    Consequently  tt Bidder1  tt  can accept a bid  process it and accept another bid before  tt Bidder2  tt  can commit to accepting a bid      Efficiency    As pointed out in Knabe  1992   an issue with the above protocol    Actor model and process calculi A simple distributed protocol A simple distributed protocol    is the large number of communications that must be sent in order to perform the handshaking in order to send a message through a synchronous channel   Indeed as shown in the previous section    Actor model and process calculi Livelock on getting from multiple channels Livelock     the number of communications can be unbounded      Summary of Issues    The subsections above have articulated the following three issues concerned with the use of synchronous channels for process calculi     Starvation    The use of sychronous channels can cause starvation when a process attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command     Livelock    The use of synchronous channels can cause a process to be caught in livelock when it attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command     Efficiency     The use of synchronous channels can require a large number of communications in order to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command   It is notable that in all of the above  issues arise from the use of a guarded choice command to get messages from multiple channels     Asynchronous channels   Asynchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel need not wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel      Simple asynchronous channels     An asynchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives  tt put  tt  and  tt get  tt  communications   The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple asynchronous channel   Each  tt put  tt  communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent immediately  without waiting for the message to be gotten by a  tt get  tt  communication    Each  tt get  tt   communication has an address to which the gotten message is sent      Asynchronous channels in process calculi    The Join calculus programming language  published in 1996  implemented local and distributed concurrent computations   It incorporated asynchronous channels as well as a kind of synchronous channel that is used for procedure calls  Agha s A  Actor calculus   harv Agha and Thati 2004   is based on a typed version of the asynchronous   Pi calculus   calculus       Algebras   The use of algebraic techniques was pioneered in the process calculi   Subsequently several different process calculi intended to provide algebraic reasoning about Actor systems have been developed in   harv Gaspari and Zavattaro 1997      harv Gaspari and Zavattaro 1999      harv Agha and Thati 2004      Denotational Semantics   Will Clinger  building on

dissertation   in 1981   His semantics contrasted the   unbounded nondeterminism   of the   Actor model   with the bounded nondeterminism of   Communicating Sequential Processes CSP    Hoare 1978  and Concurrent Processes  Milne and Milner 1979   see   denotational semantics     Roscoe  2005  has developed a denotational semantics with unbounded nondeterminism for a subsequent version of Communicating Sequential Processes Hoare  1985    More recently   Carl Hewitt    2006b  developed a denotational semantics for Actors based on   Denotational semantics of the Actor model The Timed

Ref improve section date September 2010    Google uses its   Internet search   technology to serve advertisements based on website content  the user s geographical location  and other factors  Those wanting to advertise with Google s targeted advertisement system may enroll through   AdWords    AdSense has become a popular method of placing advertising on a website because the advertisements are less intrusive than most   banner ads banners    and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website   Many websites use AdSense to monetize their content  it is the most popular advertising network  AdSense has been particularly important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs and sales people  To fill a website with advertisements that are relevant to the topics discussed  webmasters implement a brief script on the websites  pages  Websites that are content rich have been very successful with this advertising program  as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website   Some webmasters invest significant effort into maximizing their own AdSense income  They do this in three ways   Citation needed date June 2008     They use a wide range of   Web traffic traffic   generating techniques  including but not limited to   online advertising      They build valuable content on their websites that attracts AdSense advertisements  which pay out the most when they are clicked    They use text content on their websites that encourages visitors to click on advertisements  Note that Google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like  Click on my AdSense ads  to increase click rates  The phrases accepted are  Sponsored Links  and  Advertisements    The source of all AdSense income is the AdWords program  which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a   Vickrey auction Vickrey   second price auction  AdSense commands an advertiser to submit a sealed bid  i e   a bid not observable by competitors   Additionally  for any given click received  advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second highest bid  Google currently shares 68

used in conjunction with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance  AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those instances

  math  is updated that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the classification  On each round  the weights of each incorrectly classified example are increased  or alternatively  the weights of each correctly classified example are decreased   so that the new classifier focuses more on those examples       The algorithm for the binary classification task    Given   math  x  1

988|Adaptive sort|A   sorting algorithm   falls into the    adaptive sort    family if it takes advantage of existing order in its input   It benefits from the presortedness in the input sequence   or a limited amount of   randomness disorder   for various definitions of measures of disorder   and sorts faster   Adaptive sorting is usually performed by modifying existing sorting algorithms      Motivation      Comparison sort Comparison based sorting algorithms   have traditionally dealt with achieving an optimal bound of   Big O notation O   n logn  when dealing with   time complexity     Adaptive sort takes advantage of the existing order of the input to try to achieve better times  so that the time taken by the algorithm to sort is a smoothly growing function of the size of the sequence   and   the disorder in the sequence   In other words  the more presorted the input is  the faster it should be sorted   This is an attractive algorithm because nearly sorted sequences are common in practice   Thus  the performance of existing sort algorithms can be improved by taking into account the existing order in the input     Note that the most worst case sorting algorithms that do optimally well in the worst case  notably   heap sort   and   merge sort    do not take existing order within their input into account  although this deficiency is easily rectified in the case of   merge sort   by checking if left last item   right first item  in which case a merge operation may be replaced by simple concatenation   a modification that is well within the scope of making an algorithm adaptive      Examples    A classic example of an adaptive sorting algorithm is   Straight Insertion Sort     In this sorting algorithm  we scan the input from left to right  repeatedly finding the position of the current item  and insert it into an array of previously sorted items   In   pseudo code   form  the   Straight Insertion Sort   algorithm could look something like this        procedure      Straight Insertion Sort  X  n         X 0                 for    j    2    to    n    do         begin    i    j   1          t      X j                while    t     X i       do               begin      X i   1         X i                   i    i   1            end               X i   1       t       end      The performance of this algorithm can be described in terms of the number of   Inversion  discrete mathematics  inversions   in the input  and then T n  will be roughly equal to I A     n   1   where I A  is the number of Inversions   Using this measure of presortedness   being relative to the number of inversions     Straight Insertion Sort   takes less time to sort the closer it is to being sorted   Other examples of adaptive sorting algorithms are   Adaptive heap sort Adaptive Heap Sort   and   Adaptive Merge Sort     Dijkstra s   Smoothsort   algorithm is a variation on heap sort that is also considered an adaptive sorting algorithm     Timsort

1009|Address bus|  Unreferenced date June 2009    An    address bus    is a   computer bus    a series of lines connecting two or more devices  that is used to specify a   memory address physical address    When a   central processing unit processor   or   direct memory access DMA   enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location  it specifies that memory location on the address bus  the value to be read or written is sent on the   data bus     The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory a system can address  For example  a system with a 32 bit address bus can address 2 sup 32  sup   4 294 967 296  memory locations  If each memory address holds one bit  the addressable memory space is 4 GB     Implementation   Early processors used a wire for each bit of the address width  For example  a 16 bit address bus had 16 physical wires making up the bus  As the buses became wider  this approach became expensive in terms of the number of chip pins and board traces   Beginning with the   Mostek   4096 DRAM  multiplexed addressing became common   In a multiplexed address scheme  the address is sent in two equal parts  This halves the number of address bus signals required to connect to the memory  For example a 32 bit address bus can be implemented by using 16 wires and sending the first half of the memory address  immediately followed by the second half     Interesting examples   Accessing an individual byte frequently requires reading or writing the full bus width  a     word  computing  word      at once  In these instances the least significant bits of the address bus may not even be implemented   it is instead the responsibility of the controlling device to isolate the individual byte required from the complete word transmitted   This is the case  for instance  with the   VESA Local Bus   which lacks the two least significant bits  limiting this bus to   Data structure alignment aligned   32 bit transfers   Historically  there were also some examples of computers which were only able to address words      See also        Memory address      Computer bus      Category Computer buses  Address bus      bg                  de Bus  Datenverarbeitung  Adressbus     et Aadressisiin     es Bus de direcciones     fr Bus d adresse     nl Adresbus     ja            pl Szyna adresowa     pt Barramento de endere os     ru                 sv Adressbuss     ta                     zh        
1015|Address space layout randomization|  Original research date October 2008     Refimprove date October 2008       Address space layout randomization        ASLR     is a   Computer insecurity computer security   technique which involves randomly arranging the positions of key data areas  usually including the base of the   executable   and position of   Library  computer science  libraries      Dynamic memory allocation heap    and   Stack based memory allocation stack    in a   Process  computer science  process   s   address space        Benefits    Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses   For example  attackers trying to execute   return to libc attack  s must locate the code to be executed  while other attackers trying to execute   shellcode   injected on the stack have to find the stack first   In both cases  the related memory addresses are obscured from the attackers  These values have to be guessed  and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing       Effectiveness     Address space layout randomization relies on the low chance of an attacker guessing where randomly placed areas are located  Security is increased by increasing the search space   Thus  address space randomization is more effective when more   Information entropy entropy   is present in the random offsets   Entropy is increased by either raising the amount of   virtual memory virtual memory area   space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs  The period is typically implemented as small as possible  so most systems must increase VMA space randomization   To defeat the randomization  attackers must successfully guess the positions of all areas they wish to attack   For data areas such as stack and heap  where custom code or useful data can be loaded  more than one state can be attacked by using   NOP slide  s for code or repeated copies of data  This allows an attack to succeed if the area is randomized to one of a handful of values   In contrast  code areas such as library base and main executable need to be discovered exactly   Often these areas are mixed  for example   stack frame  s are injected onto the stack and a library is returned into   To begin  let us declare the following variables     math E s    mbox entropy bits of stack top     math    math E m    mbox entropy bits of mmap   base     math    math E x    mbox entropy bits of main executable base     math

   math    math N   E s A s   E m A m   E x A x   E h A h    math   To calculate the probability of an attacker succeeding  we have to assume a number of attempts  math  alpha  math  carried out without being interrupted by a signature based IPS  law enforcement  or other factor  in the case of brute forcing  the daemon cannot be restarted   We also have to figure out how many bits are relevant and how many are being attacked in each attempt  leaving however many bits the attacker has to defeat   The following formulas represent the probability of success for a given set of  math

on   as of   2009   alt   modern     64 bit   systems  these numbers typically reach the millions at least  For 32 bit systems at 2004 computer speeds which have 16 bits for address randomization  Shacham and co workers state    16 bits of address randomization can be defeated by a   brute force attack   within minutes   ref On the Effectiveness of Address Space Randomization Shacham  H  and Page  M  and Pfaff  B  and Goh  E J  and Modadugu  N  and Boneh  D Proceedings of the 11th ACM conference on Computer and communications security pp 298  307  2004  ref   It should be noted that the authors  statement depends on the ability to attack the same application multiple times without any delay   Proper implementations of ASLR  like that included in   grsecurity    provide several methods to make such brute force attacks infeasible   One method involves preventing an executable from executing for a configurable amount of time if it has crashed a certain number of times   Some systems implement   Library Load Order Randomization    a form of ASLR which randomizes the order in which libraries are loaded   This supplies very little entropy   An approximation of the number of bits of entropy supplied per needed library is shown below  this does not yet account for varied library sizes  so the actual entropy gained is really somewhat higher   Note that attackers usually need only one library  the math is more complex with multiple libraries  and shown below as well   Note that the case of an attacker using only one library is a simplification of the more complex formula for  math l   1  math      math  l    mbox number of libraries loaded   math    math   beta      mbox number of libraries used by the attacker   math     math E m    log 2  left  l  right      beta     1  l  ge    1  math    math E m    sum  i l   l    left    beta     1  right     log 2  left  i  right      beta    ge    1  l  ge    1  math   These values tend to be low even for large values of  math l  math   most importantly since attackers typically can use only the   C standard library   and thus one can often assume that  math  beta     1  math    Interestingly  however  even for a small number of libraries there are a few bits of entropy gained here  it is thus potentially interesting to combine library load order randomization with VMA address randomization to gain a few extra bits of entropy   Note that these extra bits of entropy will not apply to other mmap   segments  only libraries        Reducing entropy      Attackers may make use of several methods to reduce the entropy present in a randomized address space  ranging from simple information leaks to attacking multiple bits of entropy per attack  such as by   heap spraying      There is little that can be done about this   It is possible to leak information about memory layout using   format string vulnerability format string vulnerabilities     Format string functions such as   printf     use a   variable argument list   to do their job  format specifiers describe what the argument list looks like   Because of the way arguments are typically passed  each format specifier moves closer to the top of the stack frame   Eventually  the return pointer and stack frame pointer can be extracted  revealing the address of a vulnerable library and the address of a known stack frame  this can completely eliminate library and stack randomization as an obstacle to an attacker   One can also decrease entropy in the stack or heap   The stack typically must be aligned to 16 bytes  and so this is the smallest possible randomization interval  while the heap must be page aligned  typically 4096 bytes   When attempting an attack  it is possible to align duplicate attacks with these intervals  a   NOP slide   may be used with shellcode injection  and the string   bin sh  can be replaced with          bin sh  for an arbitrary number of slashes when attempting to return to   system       The number of bits removed is exactly  math log 2  left  n  right    math  for  math n  math  intervals attacked   Such decreases are limited due to the amount of data in the stack or heap   The stack  for example  is typically limited to 8   Megabyte MB   ref name Prefix2   BDprefix p b    ref  and grows to much less  this allows for at most 19 bits  although a more conservative estimate would be around 8 10 bits corresponding to 4 16   Kilobyte KB   ref name Prefix2   BDprefix p b    ref  of stack stuffing   The heap on the other hand is limited by the behavior of the memory allocator  in the case of   glibc    allocations above 128 KB are created using   mmap      limiting attackers to 5 bits of reduction   This is also a limiting factor when brute forcing  although the number of attacks to perform can be reduced  the size of the attacks is increased enough that the behavior could in some circumstances become analogous to   intrusion detection systems        History    The   PaX   project first coined the term  ASLR    It published the first design and implementation of ASLR in July  2001   This remains the most complete implementation  providing also kernel stack randomization from October 2002 onward   It also continues to provide the most entropy for each randomized layout compared to other implementations  ref Comparison of PaX to ExecShield and W X  ref

19 bits of stack entropy on a period of 16 bytes  and 8 bits of mmap   base randomization on a period of 1 page of 4096 bytes   This places the stack base in an area 8 MB wide containing 524 288

feature is in use only for the network facing daemons   the PIE feature cannot be used together with the   prelink   feature for the same executable   The   prelink   tool implements randomization at

to build applications built on a movie   interface metaphor metaphor    with the user as the  director  of the movie  Originally designed for creating animation sequences  the addition of a powerful scripting language called   Lingo  programming language  Lingo   made it a popular choice for creating CD ROMs and standalone kiosks and web content using Adobe   Adobe Shockwave Shockwave    Adobe Director supports both 2D and 3D multimedia projects      Comparing Director to Flash    The differences between these two products has been the subject of much discussion  especially in the Director development community  Extensibility is one of the main differences between the two  as are some of the sundry codecs that can be imported   Director has tended to be the larger of the two  but that footprint has been part of its weakness  This weakness manifest into the erosion of Director s ubiquity as the leader of authoring tools  especially in the critical window of 1998   2000   The download footprint of the Director Shockwave plugin was significantly larger than the Shockwave Flash download footprint   Additionally  Macromedia partnered with distributors such as Dell  Apple  etc  to have the Flash plugin pre installed on machines for users  so that they would not be prompted to install any additional software   At that point in time  1998 2000   broadband internet access was not the norm for most users  and the fivefold difference in size was catastrophic     History   Director started out as   MacroMind    VideoWorks   an application for the original   Apple Macintosh    Animations were initially limited to the black and white of early Macintosh screens   The name was changed to  Director  in 1987  with the addition of new capabilities and the Lingo scripting language in 1988  A   Microsoft Windows Windows   version was available in the early 1990s   From 1995 to 1997 a competing multimedia authoring program appeared called mTropolis  from mFactory   In 1997 mTropolis was purchased and buried by Quark  who had its own plans into multimedia authoring with Quark Immedia      Product Timeline          1985       VideoWorks       1988       Named Director 1 0

product and to create a vector based animation platform for   World Wide Web    hence FutureSplash Animator was created  Initially  the only way to deploy such animations on the web was through the use of   Java platform    however  the Java platform was later replaced with the   Netscape   s   plug in  computing  plug in   architecture  The FutureSplash animation technology was used on several

programs such as   swfmill      SWFTools    and   MTASC   provide tools to create SWF files  but do so by compiling text  actionscript or XML files into   Flash animation  s  It is also possible to

programming language  Ruby      haXe   is an open source  high level object oriented programming language geared towards web content creation that can compile Flash files   Many   shareware   developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US 50 between 2000 and 2002  In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third party Flash creation tool makers out of the market  allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices  although many of the products still cost less than US 100 and support ActionScript  As for open source

 Among the most famous of these are   Screencast   tools  which leverage the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content in order to produce demos  tutorials  or software simulations of programs  These programs are typically designed for use by non programmers  and create Flash content quickly and easily  but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code  i e  the tweening and transforms  etc     Screencam   is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format  having been developed since the mid 90s  The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash s presence as a ubiquitous cross platform animation file format   Other tools are focused on creating specific types of Flash content    Anime Studio   is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation which creates SWF files    Express Animator   is similarly aimed specifically

distinctive aspects   GoLive incorporates a largely   modeless   workflow that relies heavily on   drag and drop    Most user interaction is done via a contextual   Inspector window inspector   rather than the modal workflow found in   Dreamweaver    Among its features are a separate editor for tables that supports nesting  and a two dimensional panel for applying   CSS   styles to elements  GoLive supports   drag and drop   of native   Adobe Photoshop   and   Adobe Illustrator   files via what the company calls  Smart Objects   which then automatically guide the user through saving those files in web supported formats  Updates to the original Photoshop or Illustrator assets are automatically tracked by GoLive  As a web site management tool  GoLive allows users to transfer and publish content directly from within the application  and allows individual files to be excluded from uploading     Language and framework structure   Adobe GoLive is   Source code coded   in the   C

using a standard C   framework such as   PowerPlant   or   Microsoft Foundation Class Library MFC    GoLive uses a custom C   framework called SCL  Simple Class Library  which was initially built from scratch by the engineers at GoLive Systems Inc  The SCL framework was also used in the short lived   Adobe Atmosphere   3D software     Features   GoLive has a powerful set of extensibility   Application programming interface APIs   which can be used to add additional functionality to the product  The GoLive   Software development kit SDK   provides interfaces which allow developers to use

Adobe Photoshop     raster image   editing product  targeted at hobbyist users and hence sold at a fraction  roughly 1 6th  of the cost of the professional product  It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options  The program allows users to create  edit  organize and share images  all from the same product   Originally introduced alongside Photoshop version 7  Photoshop Elements targets photography enthusiasts and thus lacks many features that make it useful in a proper print production environment  For example  Photoshop Elements cannot export files in the   CMYK   color mode  without using a third party plug in   supports a simplified color management system  and excludes detailed soft proofing  It also either eliminates completely or offers simplified versions of some of the more powerful plug ins  and instead has a number of features aimed at non experts  such as removing the   red eye effect   or changing the skin tone in a picture   An example of a redesigned feature would be the Variations correction dialog  Some versions can  however  open  edit  and save   PDF  s   Photoshop LE  Limited Edition  was Adobe s consumer

volume production  When the initiative started  RISC based systems  running at 100 200 MHz at the time  had substantial performance advantage over   Intel 80486   and original   Intel P5 Pentium

There were other potential conflicts  earlier that year  MIPS had been purchased by SGI  which may have also contributed to concerns about the neutrality of the target platform  DEC had released their

1174|Affix grammar|  Noref date February 2009   An    affix grammar    is a kind of   formal grammar    it is used to describe the   syntax   of languages  mainly   computer language  s  using an approach based on how natural language is typically described   The grammatical rules of an affix grammar are those of a   context free grammar    except that certain parts in the nonterminals  the   affix  es  are used as arguments   If the same affix occurs multiple times in a rule  its value must   agreement  linguistics  agree    i e  it must be the same everywhere   In some types of affix grammar  more complex relationships between affix values are possible       Example     We can describe an extremely simple fragment of English in the following manner    code      Sentence    rarr    Subject     Predicate       Subject    rarr    Noun       Predicate    rarr    Verb     Object       Object    rarr    Noun         Noun    rarr  John     Noun    rarr  Mary     Noun    rarr  children     Noun    rarr  parents       Verb    rarr  like     Verb    rarr  likes     Verb    rarr  help     Verb    rarr  helps   code   This   context free grammar   describes simple sentences such as   code    John likes children   Mary helps John   children help parents   parents like John   code   With more nouns and verbs  and more rules to introduce other parts of speech  a large range of English sentences can be described  so this is a promising approach for describing the syntax of English   However  the given grammar also describes sentences such as   code    John like children   children helps parents   code   These sentences are wrong  in English  subject and verb have a   grammatical number    which must agree   An affix grammar can express this directly   code      Sentence  rarr  Subject number Predicate number       Subject number  rarr  Noun number       Predicate number  rarr  Verb number Object       Object  rarr  Noun number         Noun   singular  rarr  John     Noun   singular  rarr  Mary     Noun   plural  rarr  children     Noun   plural  rarr  parents       Verb   singular  rarr  like     Verb   plural  rarr  likes     Verb   singular  rarr  help     Verb   plural  rarr  helps   code   This grammar only describes correct English sentences  although it could be argued that  code    John likes John   code  is still incorrect and should instead read  code    John likes himself   code   This  too  can be incorporated using affixes  if the means of describing the relationships between different affix values are powerful enough  As remarked above  these means depend on the type of affix grammar chosen      Types of affix grammars     In the simplest type of affix grammar  affixes can only take values from a finite domain  and affix values can only be related through agreement  as in the example  Applied in this way  affixes increase compactness of grammars  but do not add expressive power   Another approach is to allow affixes to take arbitrary strings as values and allow   concatenations of affixes to be used in rules   The ranges of allowable values for affixes can be described with context free grammar rules   This produces the formalism of   two level grammars    also known as     Van Wijngaarden grammar  s   or   2VW   grammars   These have been successfully used to describe complicated languages  in particular  the syntax of the   Algol 68     programming language     However  it turns out that  even though affix values can only be manipulated with string concatenation  this formalism is   Turing complete    hence  even the most basic questions about the language described by an arbitrary 2VW grammar are   Undecidable language undecidable   in general     Extended Affix Grammar  s  developed in the 1980s  are a more restricted version of the same idea   They were mainly applied to describe the grammar of natural language  e g  English   Another possibility is to allow the values of affixes to be computed by code written in some programming language   Two basic approaches have been used    In   attribute grammar  s  the affixes  called attributes  can take values from arbitrary domains  e g  integer or real numbers  complex data structures  and arbitrary functions can be specified  written in a language of choice  to describe how affix values in rules are derived from each other    In CDL  the   Compiler Description Language    and its successor   CDL2    developed in the 1970s  fragments of source code  usually in   assembly language    can be used in rules instead of normal right hand sides  allowing primitives for input scanning and affix value computations to be expressed directly   Designed as a basis for practical   compiler   construction  this approach was used to write compilers  and other software  e g  a   text editor        See also      Extended Affix Grammar      Attribute grammar      Van Wijngaarden grammar       References       reflist

deletable image caption 1 Wednesday  23 January 2008            Essay like date August 2010     Debate date January 2011   An    air source   heat pump      uses outside air as a heat source or heat sink  A compressor  condenser and refrigerant system is used to absorb heat at one place and release it at another     General   Outside   air    necessarily existing at some temperature above   absolute zero    is a heat container  An air source heat pump moves   pumps   some of this heat to provide hot water or household heating  This can be done in either direction  to cool or heat the interior of a building   The main components of an air source heat pump are    a heat exchanger  over which outside air is blown  to extract the heat from the air   a compressor  which acts like a refrigerator but in reverse and raises the temperature from the outside air   a way to transfer the heat into a hot water tank or heating system  such as radiators or under floor heating tubes    How air source heat pumps work      File Refrigerator cycle svg thumb A  indoor compartment  B  outdoor compartment  I  insulation  1  condenser  2  expansion valve  3  evaporator  4  compressor    Heating and cooling is accomplished by moving a   refrigerant   through the heat pump s various indoor and outdoor   coil  s and components   A   gas compressor compressor      Condenser  heat transfer  condenser      expansion valve   and   evaporator   are used to change states of the refrigerant from a   liquid   to hot   gas   and from a gas to a cold liquid  The refrigerant is used to heat or cool coils in a   building   or   room   and   Fan  mechanical  fans   pull the room air over the coils  An external outdoor   heat exchanger   is used to heat or cool the refrigerant  This use of outside   air   has led to the term  Air Source  Heat Pump  The overall operation uses the concepts described in classic   vapor compression refrigeration     When the liquid refrigerant at a low   temperature   passes through the outdoor evaporator coils  the temperature of the outside air causes the liquid to boil  This change of state from liquid to a vapor requires a considerable amount of   energy   or    latent heat    which is provided by outside air passing over the coils   This   vapor   is then drawn into the compressor where the temperature of the vapor is boosted to well over 100 degrees   Celsius    At this point we have used heat from the outside air to change the liquid refrigerant to a gas and added an amount of compression  work  to raise the temperature of the vapor  The vapor now enters the condenser heat exchanger coils where it begins to transfer heat to the air being drawn across the coils  As the vapor cools  it condenses back to a liquid and in so doing releases and transfers considerable latent heat to the air passing over the condenser unit coils  We have used the heat energy of outside air to change the phase of the refrigerant and then released this heat for heating  a typical   heat pump   operation   At this stage we now have a very cold liquid refrigerant compressed to a high pressure  The refrigerant is next passed through an expansion   valve   which turns it back to a low pressure cold liquid ready to re enter the evaporator to begin a new cycle   The heat pump can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air     Efficiency   The  Efficiency  of air source heat pumps is measured by the   Coefficient of performance    COP   In simple terms  a COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes   In mild weather  the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4  However  on a very cold winter day  it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day  The heat pump s performance is limited by the   Carnot cycle   and will approach 1 0 as the outdoor to indoor temperature difference increases at around  18  C  0  F  outdoor temperature for air source heat pumps   However  heat pump construction methods that enable use of carbon dioxide refrigerant extend the figure downward to  30  C   22  F     A   Geothermal heat pump   will have less change in COP as the ground temperature from which they extract heat is more constant than outdoor air temperature   Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the   heating seasonal performance factor    HSPF  and   seasonal energy efficiency ratio    SEER  respectively   The efficiency of a heat pump can be significantly affected by its original design  Many air source heat pumps began life as air conditioning units  designed for summer temperatures  In  http   www globalenergysystems co uk features products why eco air boilers html designing a heat pump  as a heat pump from inception great COPs and life cycles can be attained  The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator to allow  http   www globalenergysystems co uk how it works coefficient performance html COP  of greater than 2 even down to  20 C     Advantages and disadvantages      Advantages       Typically draws approximately 1 3 to 1 4 of the electricity of a standard   resistance heater   for the same amount of heating  reducing utility bills  ref   cite web title Georgia

needed date January 2010      Few moving parts  reducing maintenance requirements  However  it should be ensured that the outdoor heat exchanger and fan is kept free from leaves and debris  Moreover  it must be borne in mind that a heat pump will have significantly more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater    As an electric system  no flammable or potentially asphyxiating fuel is used at the point of heating  reducing the potential danger to users  and removing the need to obtain gas or fuel supplies  except for electricity     May be used to heat air  or water    The same system may be used for air conditioning in summer  as well as a heating system in winter    lower running costs  the compressor being the thing that uses most power

pump designs   Air source heat pumps require electricity for operation    Electricity generation   accounts for a significant amount of emissions pollutants and greenhouse gases   External space needs to be found for the outside condenser unit which can be somewhat noisy comparable to an air conditioner unit    Citation needed date September 2009   and possibly unsightly   The   cost   of installation is high  though less than a   Geothermal heat pump Ground Source heat pump   because a ground source heat pump requires installation of a ground loop    The following disadvantages are associated with units charged with   Organofluorine chemistry Hydrofluorocarbons HFC     refrigerants     Usually marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology  the HFCs have the potential to contribute to global warming  Citation needed date September 2009     The effect the refrigerant could have is measured in   global warming potential    GWP  and   ozone depletion potential    ODP    Air source heat pumps lose their efficiency as external temperatures fall below 5 degrees celsius  In colder climates the system needs to be installed with an auxiliary source of heat to providing heat at low temperatures or if the heat pump should require repair   The outdoor section on some units may  frost up  when outdoor temperatures are between 0 C and 5 C and there is sufficient moisture in the air  Citation needed date November 2010    which causes restriction of air flow across the outdoor coil   These units employ a time delay or demand defrost cycle where the system a  switches to  a c  mode for up to 10 minutes to move heat from the home to the outdoor section to melt the ice and b  turns on the supplemental heater  resistance electric  gas  etc   in the indoor section to temper the cold air being distributed   The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly  although the newer  demand  systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less   As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air   An air source heat pump switching out of defrost mode in normal operation emits a characteristic  whoosh  sound from the outdoor section   Citation needed date November 2010    The COP is reduced when heat pumps are used to reach over 60 C for heating domestic water or in conventional   central heating   systems using radiators to distribute heat  instead of an underfloor heating array    Retrofit is difficult when used with conventional heating systems using radiators or radiant panels  The lower Heat Pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature   underfloor heating   system be installed instead     Conclusions    Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating  A high efficiency heat pump can provide four times the heat compared to an electric heater  ref   cite web

1292|Akaike information criterion|The    Akaike information criterion    is a measure of the   goodness of fit   of a   statistical model    It was developed by   Hirotsugu Akaike    under the name of  an information criterion      AIC      and was first published by Akaike in 1974  ref name  Akaiki1974  Akaike  1974  ref  It is grounded in the concept of   information entropy    in effect offering a relative measure of the   Kullback Leibler divergence information lost   when a given model is used to describe reality   It can be said to describe the tradeoff between   bias   and   variance   in model construction  or loosely speaking that of accuracy and complexity of the model   The AIC is not a test of the model in the sense of hypothesis testing  rather  it provides a means for comparison among models mdash a tool for    model selection    Given a data set  several candidate models may be ranked according to their AIC  with the model having the minimum AIC being the best  From the AIC values one may also infer that e g  the top two models are roughly in a tie and the rest are far worse     Definition   In the general case  the AIC is    math  mathit AIC    2k   2 ln L     math   where   k   is the number of   parameter  s in the   statistical model    and   L   is the maximized value of the   likelihood   function for the estimated model   Given a set of candidate models for the data    the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value     Hence AIC not only rewards goodness of fit  but also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters  This penalty discourages   overfitting    increasing the number of free parameters in the model improves the goodness of fit  regardless of the number of free parameters in the data generating process     The AIC methodology attempts to find the model  among a candidate set of models  that best explains the data with the fewest free parameters  By contrast  more traditional approaches to modeling start from a   null hypothesis     From a Bayesian perspective  the AIC corresponds to adopting a prior  math  P k   propto  exp   k    math  to penalise models with large numbers of parameters  math k  math    Citation needed date October 2010    The posterior is then  math  P k data   propto P data k  P k     exp    mathit AIC  2    math      How to apply AIC in practice   AIC estimates relative support for a model   To apply this in practice  we start with a set of candidate models  and then find the models  corresponding AIC values   Next  identify the minimum AIC value   The selection of a model can then be made as follows    blockquote As a rough rule of thumb  models having their AIC within 1 ndash 2 of the minimum have substantial support and should receive consideration in making inferences   Models having their AIC within about 4 ndash 7 of the minimum have considerably less support  while models with their AIC   10 above the minimum have either essentially no support and might be omitted from further consideration or at least fail to explain some substantial structural variation in the data  ref Burnham   Anderson  2002  p 446  slightly paraphrased  ref   blockquote     Partial derivation   For this section  it will be assumed that the model errors are normally and independently distributed  Let   n   be the number of   observation  s and   RSS   be   math  mathit RSS      sum  i 1  n  hat  varepsilon  i 2   math  the   residual sum of squares    We further assume that the variance of the model errors is unknown but equal for them all  Maximizing the likelihood with respect to this variance  the AIC becomes    math  mathit AIC  2k   n  ln 2 pi  mathit RSS  n    1      math   This can be simplified by factoring out the term  math n  ln 2 pi   math   This is a constant term added to the AIC value of all the competing models  Therefore it can t affect the order in which we rank them and we can safely remove this term  When we also factor out the constant  math n  math   AIC simplifies to     math  mathit AIC  2k   n  ln  mathit RSS        math     Relevance to  math  chi 2  math  fitting   Often  one wishes to select amongst competing models where the likelihood function assumes that the underlying errors are normally distributed and independent  This assumption leads to  math  chi 2  math  data fitting   For any set of models where the data points are used  one can use a slightly altered AIC  For the purposes of this article  this will be called  math AIC   chi 2   math   It differs from the AIC only through an additive constant  which is a function only of the data points and not of the model  As only differences in the AIC are relevant  this constant can be ignored   For  math  chi 2  math  fitting  the likelihood is given by   math L  prod  i 1  n  left  frac 1  2  pi  sigma i 2  right   1 2   exp  left    sum  i 1   n  frac  y i f  mathbf x    2  2 sigma i 2  right   math    math  therefore  ln L    ln left  prod  i 1  n left  frac 1  2 pi sigma i 2  right   1 2  right     frac 1  2  sum  i 1  n  frac  y i f  mathbf x    2   sigma i 2   math    math  therefore  ln L   C    chi 2 2     math   where C is a constant independent of the model used  and dependent only on the use of particular data points  i e  it does not change if the data do not change   The AIC is therefore given by  math AIC   2k   2 ln L    2k   2 C  chi 2 2    2k  2C    chi 2     math   As only differences in AICc are meaningful  the constant C can be omitted provided the same data points are used  giving   math AIC   chi 2   chi 2   2k  math   This form is often convenient in that data fitting programs produce  math  chi 2  math  as a statistic for the fit  For models with the same number of data points  the one with the lowest  math AIC   chi 2   math  should be preferred   Similarly  if one has available the statistic  math R 2  math    Variance Explained    one may write    math AIC  R 2  n ln frac 1 R 2  n  2k     math   The Pearson correlation  math r R  math  is a special case of this  Here  independence of the observations is assumed     AICc and AICu   AICc is AIC with a second order correction for finite sample sizes     math AICc   AIC    frac 2k k   1   n   k   1     chi 2    frac 2k   1    frac k 1  n         math   where   k   denotes the number of model parameters   Burnham   Anderson  2002  strongly recommend using AICc  rather than AIC  if   n   is small or   k   is large  Since AICc converges to AIC as   n   gets large  AICc generally should be employed regardless  ref Burnham   Anderson  2004  ref     Brockwell   Davis  p 273  advise using AICc as the primary criterion in selecting the orders of an   ARMA   model for time series   McQuarrie   Tsai  1998  22  define AICc as     math AICc    ln  frac RSS  n      frac n k  n k 2      math   and propose  p  32  the closely related measure     math AICu    ln  frac RSS  n k      frac n k  n k 2      math   McQuarrie   Tsai ground their high opinion of AICc and AICu on extensive simulation work     QAIC   QAIC  the quasi AIC  is defined as     math QAIC   2k  frac 1  c 2 ln L     math   where   c   is a variance inflation factor  QAIC adjusts for over dispersion or lack of fit  The small sample version of QAIC is    math QAICc   QAIC    frac 2k k   1   n   k   1      math      Schwarz criterion   The AIC penalizes free parameters less strongly than does the   Schwarz criterion     After Schwarz developed his   Schwarz Information Criterion   in 1978 using Bayesian formalism  Akaike was inspired to develop a Bayesian version of his information criteria as well often denoted the ABIC  for  a Bayesian Information Criterion   or commonly referred to as Akaike s Bayesian Information Criterion  The fact that Akaike developed two similar Information Critera during the 1970 s has created some confusion in the literature as to what is precisely the AIC  It is of the general form    math  mathit ABIC    2 ln  L   marginal   2 k       math   In a more tractable setting  the ABIC for a polynomial of degree k is      math  mathit ABIC  n  ln  mathit RSS    2k     math   Since the this information criterion has the same relationship to approximating the evidence  the likelihood probability times the prior probability   then it too can claim status as a Bayesian Information Criterion    See also      Bayesian information criterion      Deviance  statistics  deviance      Deviance information criterion      Hannan Quinn information criterion      Jensen Shannon divergence

Ph D  degree from   Princeton University   in 1979  where his advisor was   Jeffrey Ullman    After that he was a post doctoral fellow at the   IBM T J  Watson Research Center   for a year before joining the faculty of the   University of Toronto   in 1980   He was one of the pioneers who helped to lay the foundations of   relational databases    His early work on database dependencies has been influential in both the theory and practice of data management  He has made fundamental contributions in the areas of graphical query languages  knowledge base systems  and on line analytic processing  His work has provided the foundation for languages used to query the structure of the web   Mendelzon established some of the earliest results on using the relational data model  Together with his thesis advisor    Jeffrey Ullman    and fellow Princeton students  including   David Maier   and   Yeshoshua Sagiv    he co authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases  In a now famous paper  Maier  Mendelzon and Sagiv  TODS 1979   he introduced the   chase  database theory  chase    a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the   database theory   literature  This work has been highly influential  it is used  directly or indirectly  on an everyday basis by people who design databases  and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design  New applications of the chase in meta data management and data exchange are still being discovered   In the 1980s  Mendelzon began an important line of work on graphical query languages  His work has been called prescient as it began before the   World Wide Web    and nonetheless established many of the scientific principles required for designing languages to query the Web   More recently  Mendelzon was a central figure in the work on view based querying  Starting with the innovative LMSS95 paper  Levy  Mendelzon  Sagiv  and Srivastava  PODS 1995  that introduced the problem of answering queries using views  Alberto Mendelzon made several important contributions to the emerging area of view based modeling and processing   His research was central to the development of many areas of database research such as database design  semantic   query optimization    graphical query languages  and querying web data  In addition  he also made important contributions to recursive query languages  on line analytic processing  similarity based queries  data warehouses and view maintenance  algorithms for computing web page reputations  and indexing of   XML   data   Mendelzon was an active member of both the   database theory   and   database systems   research communities  He served as the PC Chair for ACM   PODS   in 1991 and as General Chair in both 1997 and 1998  He served as PC Chair for   VLDB   in 1992  and as a member of the

1442|Algebraic topology|  For the topology of pointwise convergence Algebraic topology  object       Algebraic topology    is a branch of   mathematics   which uses tools from   abstract algebra   to study   topological space  s  The basic goal is to find algebraic   invariant  mathematics  invariants   that   classification theorem classify   topological spaces   up to     homeomorphism    though usually most classify up to   Homotopy Homotopy equivalence and null homotopy homotopy equivalence     Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems  using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible  Algebraic topology  for example  allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a   free group   is again a free group     The method of algebraic invariants    An older name for the subject was   combinatorial topology    implying an emphasis on how a space X was constructed from simpler ones  the modern standard tool for such construction is the   CW complex CW complex     The basic method now applied in algebraic topology is to investigate spaces via algebraic invariants by mapping them  for example  to   group  mathematics  groups   which have a great deal of manageable structure in a way that respects the relation of   homeomorphism    or more general   homotopy    of spaces   This allows one to recast statements about topological spaces into statements about groups  which are often easier to prove   Two major ways in which this can be done are through   fundamental group  s  or more generally   homotopy theory    and through   homology  mathematics  homology   and   cohomology   groups  The fundamental groups give us basic information about the structure of a topological space  but they are often   abelian group nonabelian   and can be difficult to work with  The fundamental group of a  finite    simplicial complex   does have a finite   presentation of a group presentation     Homology and cohomology groups  on the other hand  are abelian and in many important cases finitely generated    Finitely generated abelian group  s are completely classified and are particularly easy to work with     Setting in category theory   In general  all constructions of algebraic topology are   category theory functorial    the notions of   Category  mathematics  category      functor   and   natural transformation   originated here  Fundamental groups and homology and cohomology groups are not only   invariants   of the underlying topological space  in the sense that two topological spaces which are   homeomorphic   have the same associated groups  but their associated morphisms also correspond   a continuous mapping of spaces induces a group homomorphism on the associated groups  and these homomorphisms can be used to show non existence  or  much more deeply  existence  of mappings     Results on homology   Several useful results follow immediately from working with finitely generated abelian groups  The free rank of the   n   th homology group of a simplicial complex is equal to the   n   th   Betti number    so one can use the homology groups of a simplicial complex to calculate its   Euler Poincar  characteristic    As another example  the top dimensional integral homology group of a closed   manifold   detects   orientable orientability    this group is isomorphic to either the integers or 0  according as the manifold is orientable or not  Thus  a great deal of topological information is encoded in the homology of a given topological space   Beyond simplicial homology  which is defined only for simplicial complexes  one can use the differential structure of smooth manifolds via   de Rham cohomology    or  ech or   sheaf cohomology   to investigate the solvability of   differential equation  s defined on the manifold in question    De Rham   showed that all of these approaches were interrelated and that  for a closed  oriented manifold  the Betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same Betti numbers as those derived through de Rham cohomology  This was extended in the 1950s  when Eilenberg and Steenrod generalized this approach  They defined homology and cohomology as   functors   equipped with   natural transformations   subject to certain axioms  e g   a   weak equivalence   of spaces passes to an isomorphism of homology groups   verified that all existing  co homology theories satisfied these axioms  and then proved that such an axiomatization uniquely characterized the theory   A new approach uses a  functor from filtered spaces to crossed complexes  defined directly and homotopically using relative homotopy groups  a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem proved for this functor enables basic results in algebraic topology  especially on the border between homology and homotopy  to be obtained without using   singular homology   or   simplicial approximation    This approach is also called   higher dimensional algebra nonabelian algebraic topology    and generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the fundamental group     Applications of algebraic topology   Classic applications of algebraic topology include    The   Brouwer fixed point theorem    every   continuous function continuous   map from the unit   n   disk to itself has a fixed point    The   n   sphere admits a nowhere vanishing continuous unit   vector fields on spheres vector field   if and only if   n   is odd   For   n     2  this is sometimes called the    hairy ball theorem        The   Borsuk Ulam theorem    any continuous map from the   n   sphere to Euclidean   n   space identifies at least one pair of antipodal points    Any subgroup of a   free group   is free  This result is quite interesting  because the statement is purely algebraic yet the simplest proof is topological  Namely  any free group   G   may be realized as the fundamental group of a   graph  mathematics  graph     X    The main theorem on   covering space  s tells us that every subgroup   H   of   G   is the fundamental group of some covering space   Y   of   X    but every such   Y   is again a graph  Therefore its fundamental group   H   is free   On the other hand this type of application is also handled by the use of covering morphisms of   groupoids    and that technique has yielded subgroup

1457|Algorithmic game theory|   Algorithmic game theory    is an area in the intersection of   Game Theory   and   Algorithm Design    whose objective is to design algorithms in   strategic   environments  Typically  in Algorithmic Game Theory problems  the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output  In those situations  the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests  On top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design  say   polynomial time running time      good approximation ratio        the designer must also care about incentive constraints  We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives       Analysis    look at the current implemented algorithms and analyze them using Game Theory tools  calculate and prove properties on their   Nash equilibria      Price of Anarchy    best response dynamics         Design    design games that have both good game theoretical and algorithmic properties  This area is called   Algorithmic Mechanism Design    The field was started when Nisan and Ronen in STOC 99  ref name  nr  Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen   http   www cs huji ac il  noam selfishJ ps Algorithmic Mechanism Design   STOC 99  ref  drawn the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish  strategic  users  As they claim in the abstract     Quote We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants annot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self interest  As such participants  termed agents  are capable of manipulating the algorithm  the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents  interests are best served by behaving correctly   Following notions from the field of mechanism design  we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms  In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism  The payments should be carefully chosen a6 to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes  We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem         The Internet as a catalyst   The Internet created a new economy   both as a foundation for exchange and commerce  and in its own right  The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy  On the other hand  the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many  This was new to the classic   top down  approach to computation that held till then  Thus  game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it  both human and mechanical   Game theory studies equilibria  such as the   Nash equilibrium     An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy  Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet  for instance financial interactions and communication load balancing  Citation needed date September 2010    Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria  and a common approach is then to  find the game    that is  to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game  and to derive the associated equilibria   Rephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet based interactions and the construction of mechanisms to meet specified demands  If equilibria can be shown to exist  a further question must be answered  can an equilibrium be found  and in reasonable time  This leads to the   analysis of algorithms   for finding equilibria  Of special importance is the complexity class   PPAD    which includes many problems

1459|Algorithmic information theory|  Expert subject Computer science date November 2008       Algorithmic information theory    is a subfield of   information theory   and   computer science   that concerns itself with the relationship between   theory of computation computation   and   Information Measuring information information    According to   Gregory Chaitin    it is  the result of putting   Claude Shannon Shannon   s information theory and   Alan Turing Turing   s computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking vigorously    ref  http   www cs auckland ac nz research groups CDMTCS docs ait php Algorithmic Information Theory     Bot generated title       ref      Overview    Algorithmic information theory principally studies   asymptotic complexity complexity   measures on   string  computer science  string  s  or other   data structure  s    Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings  or as the   Limit of a sequence limit   of a   sequence   of strings  it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects  including   integer  s and   real number  s   This use of the term  information  might be a bit misleading  as it depends upon the concept of compressibility  Informally  from the point of view of algorithmic information theory  the information content of a string is equivalent to the length of the shortest possible self contained representation of that string  A self contained representation is essentially a   program  computing  program     in some fixed but otherwise irrelevant universal   programming language     that  when run  outputs the original string   From this point of view  a 3000 page encyclopedia actually contains less information than 3000 pages of completely random letters  despite the fact that the encyclopedia is much more useful  This is because to reconstruct the entire sequence of random letters  one must know  more or less  what every single letter is  On the other hand  if every vowel were removed from the encyclopedia  someone with reasonable knowledge of the English language could reconstruct it  just as one could likely reconstruct the sentence  Ths sntnc hs lw nfrmtn cntnt  from the context and consonants present  For this reason  high information strings and sequences are sometimes called  random   people also sometimes attempt to distinguish between  information  and  useful information  and attempt to provide rigorous definitions for the latter  with the idea that the random letters may have more information than the encyclopedia  but the encyclopedia has more  useful  information   Unlike classical information theory  algorithmic information theory gives   Formal system formal      Rigour Mathematical rigour rigorous   definitions of a   Kolmogorov complexity random string   and a   algorithmically random sequence random infinite sequence   that do not depend on physical or philosophical   Intuition  knowledge  intuition  s about   nondeterminism   or   likelihood     The set of random strings depends on the choice of the universal Turing machine used to define Kolmogorov complexity  but any choice gives identical asymptotic results because the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is invariant up to an additive constant depending only on the choice of universal Turing machine  For this reason the set of random infinite sequences is independent of the choice of universal machine    Some of the results of algorithmic information theory  such as   Kolmogorov complexity Chaitin s incompleteness theorem Chaitin s incompleteness theorem    appear to challenge common mathematical and philosophical intuitions  Most notable among these is the construction of   Chaitin s constant            a real number which expresses the probability that a self delimiting universal Turing machine will   halting problem halt   when its input is supplied by flips of a fair coin  sometimes thought of as the probability that a random computer program will eventually halt   Although         is easily defined  in any   consistent     axiom  atizable   theory  mathematical logic  theory   one can only compute finitely many digits of          so it is in some sense   unknowable    providing an absolute limit on knowledge that is reminiscent of   G del s Incompleteness Theorem    Although the digits of         cannot be determined  many properties of         are known  for example  it is an   algorithmically random sequence   and thus its binary digits are evenly distributed  in fact it is   normal number normal

Information Theory    ref   who published the basic ideas on which the field is based as part of his invention of   algorithmic probability     a way to overcome serious problems associated with the application of Bayes rules in statistics   He first described his results at a Conference at   Caltech   in 1960  ref Paper from conference on  Cerebral Systems and Computers   California Institute of Technology  Feb 8 11  1960  cited in  A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference  Part 1  1964  p  1  ref  and in a report  Feb  1960   A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference   ref Solomonoff  R     http   world std com  rjs z138 pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference    Report V 131  Zator Co   Cambridge  Ma    November Revision of Feb 4  1960 report    ref   Algorithmic information theory was later developed independently by   Andrey Kolmogorov    in 1965 and   Gregory Chaitin    around 1966   There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information  the most widely used one is based on   self delimiting program  s and is mainly due to   Leonid Levin    1974     Per Martin L f   also contributed significantly to the information theory of infinite sequences  An axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory based on   Blum axioms    Blum 1967  was introduced by Mark Burgin in a paper presented for publication by   Andrey Kolmogorov    Burgin 1982   The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches in the algorithmic information theory  It is possible to treat different measures of algorithmic information as particular cases of axiomatically defined measures of algorithmic information  Instead of proving similar theorems  such as the basic invariance theorem  for each particular measure  it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting  This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics  The axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory was further developed in the book  Burgin 2005  and applied to software metrics  Burgin and Debnath  2003  Debnath and Burgin  2003       Precise Definitions       Main Kolmogorov Complexity   A binary string is said to be random if the   Kolmogorov complexity   of the string is at least the length of the string  A simple counting argument shows that some strings of any given length are random  and almost all strings are very close to being random  Since Kolmogorov complexity depends on a fixed choice of universal Turing machine  informally  a fixed  description language  in which the  descriptions  are given   the collection of random strings does depend on the choice of fixed universal machine  Nevertheless  the collection of random strings  as a whole  has similar properties regardless of the fixed machine  so one can  and often does  talk about the properties of random strings as a group without having to first specify a universal machine     Main Algorithmically random sequence   An infinite binary sequence is said to be random if  for some constant   c    for all n  the   Kolmogorov complexity   of the initial segment of length   n   of the sequence is at least   n c    Importantly  the complexity used here is prefix free complexity  if plain complexity were used  there would be no random sequences  However  with this definition  it can be shown that almost every sequence  from the point of view of the standard   measure  mathematics  measure      fair coin  or   Lebesgue measure     on the space of infinite binary sequences  is random  Also  since it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity relative to two different universal machines differs by at most a constant  the collection of random infinite sequences does not depend on the choice of universal machine  in contrast to finite strings   This definition of randomness is usually called   Martin L f   randomness  after   Per Martin L f    to distinguish it from other similar notions of randomness  It is also sometimes called   1 randomness   to distinguish it from other stronger notions of randomness  2 randomness  3 randomness  etc      Related definitions can be made for alphabets other than the set  math   0 1    math       Specific Sequence    Algorithmic information theory  AIT  is the information theory of individual objects  using computer science  and concerns itself with the relationship between computation  information  and randomness   The information content or complexity of an object can be measured by the length of its shortest description  For instance the string   code  0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101   code   has the short description  32 repetitions of  01    while   code  1100100001100001110111101110110011111010010000100101011110010110   code   presumably has no simple description other than writing down the string itself   More formally  the Algorithmic Complexity  AC  of a string x is defined as the length of the shortest program computes or outputs x  where the program is run on some fixed reference universal computer   A closely related notion is the probability that a universal computer outputs some string x when fed with a program chosen at random  This Algorithmic  Solomon off  Probability  AP  is key in addressing the old philosophical problem of induction in a formal way   The major drawback of AC and AP are their incomputability  Time bounded  Levin  complexity penalizes a slow program by adding the logarithm of its running time to its length  This leads to computable variants of AC and AP  and Universal  Levin  Search  US  solves all inversion problems in optimal  apart from some unrealistically large multiplicative constant  time   AC and AP also allow a formal and rigorous definition of randomness of individual strings do not depend on physical or philosophical intuitions about non determinism or likelihood  Roughly  a string

Algorithmic skeletons take advantage of common programming patterns to hide the complexity of parallel and distributed applications  Starting from a basic set of patterns  skeletons   more complex patterns can be built by combining the basic ones     Overview   The most outstanding feature of algorithmic skeletons  which differentiates them from other high level parallel programming models  is that orchestration and synchronization of the parallel activities is implicitly defined by the skeleton patterns  Programmers do not have to specify the synchronizations between the application s sequential parts  This yields two implications  First  as the communication data access patterns are known in advance  cost models can be applied to schedule skeletons programs ref   K  Hammond and G

More than one Future can be entered into a skeleton simultaneously    The Future allows for asynchronous computation  as other tasks can be performed while the results are computed    We can retrieve

this function will be used  this will decide whether a sub array should be subdivided again or not   The SplitList class implements the split interface  which in this case divides an  sub  array into

based skeleton framework providing skeletons such as farm  pipe and heartbeat  Skeletons are specialized using inheritance  Programmers implement the abstract methods for each skeleton to provide their application specific code  Skeletons in JaSkel are provided in both sequential  concurrent and dynamic versions  For example  the concurrent farm can be used in shared memory environments  threads   but not in distributed environments  clusters  where the distributed farm should be used  To change from one version to the other  programmers must change their classes  signature to inherit from a different skeleton  The nesting of skeletons uses the basic Java Object class  and therefore no type system is enforced during the skeleton composition   The distribution aspects of the computation are handled in    JaSkel    using AOP  more specifically the AspectJ implementation  Thus     JaSkel    can be deployed on both cluster and Grid like infrastructures  ref   J  Sobral and A  Proenca     Enabling jaskel skeletons for clusters and computational grids   In IEEE Cluster  IEEE Press  9 2007   ref   Nevertheless  a drawback of the    JaSkel    approach is that the nesting of the skeleton strictly relates to the deployment infrastructure  Thus  a double nesting of farm yields a better performance than a single farm on hierarchical infrastructures  This defeats the purpose

1998   ref  is an imperative language for skeleton programming  Skeletons are not directly part of the language but are implemented with it     Skil    uses a subset of C language which provides functional language like features such as higher order functions  curring and polymorphic types  When    Skil    is compiled  such features are eliminated and a regular C code is produced  Thus     Skil    transforms polymorphic high order functions into monomorphic first order C functions     Skil    does not support nestable composition of skeletons  Data parallelism is achieved using specific data parallel structures  for example to spread arrays among available processors  Filter skeletons can be used     Frameworks comparison        Activity Years    is the known activity years span  The dates represented in this column correspond to the first and last publication date of a related article in a scientific journal or conference proceeding  Note that a project may still be active beyond the activity span  and that we have failed to find a publication for it beyond the given date       Programming Language    is the interface with which programmers interact to code their skeleton applications  These languages are diverse  encompassing paradigms such as  functional languages  coordination languages  markup languages  imperative languages  object oriented languages  and even graphical user interfaces  Inside the programming language  skeletons have been provided either as language constructs or libraries  Providing skeletons as language construct implies the development of a custom domain specific language and its compiler  This was clearly the stronger trend at the begging of skeleton research  The more recent trend is to provide skeletons as libraries  in particular with object oriented languages such as C   and Java        Execution Language    is the language in which the skeleton applications are run or compiled  It was recognized very early that the programming languages  specially in the functional cases   were not efficient enough to execute the skeleton programs  Therefore  skeleton programming languages were simplified by executing skeleton application on other languages  Transformation processes were introduced to convert the skeleton applications  defined in the programming language  into an equivalent application on the target execution language  Different transformation processes were introduced  such as code generation or instantiation of lowerlevel skeletons  sometimes called operational skeletons  which were capable of interacting with a library in the execution language  The transformed application also gave the opportunity to introduce target architecture code  customized for performance  into the transformed application  Table 1 shows that a favorite for execution language has been the C language        Distribution Library    provides the functionality to achieve parallel distributed computations  The big favorite in this sense has been MPI  which is not surprising since it integrates well with the C language  and is probably the most used tool for parallelism in cluster computing  The dangers of directly programming with the distribution library are  of course  safely hidden away from the programmers who never interact with the distribution library  Recently  the trend has been to develop skeleton frameworks capable of interacting with more than one distribution library  For example  CO2 P3 S can use Threads  RMI or Sockets  Mallba can use Netstream or MPI  or JaSkel which uses AspectJ to execute the skeleton applications on different skeleton frameworks        Type Safety    refers to the capability of detecting type incompatibility errors in skeleton program  Since the first skeleton frameworks were built on functional languages such as Haskell  type safety was simply inherited from the host language  Nevertheless  as custom languages were developed for skeleton programming  compilers had to be written to take type checking into consideration  which was not as difficult as skeleton nesting was not fully supported  Recently however  as we begun to host skeleton frameworks on object oriented languages with full nesting  the type safety issue has resurfaced  Unfortunately  type checking has been mostly overlooked  with the exception of QUAFF   and specially in Java based skeleton frameworks        Skeleton Nesting    is the capability of hierarchical composition of skeleton patterns  Skeleton Nesting was identified as an important feature in skeleton programming from the very beginning  because it allows the composition of more complex patterns starting from a basic set of simpler patterns  Nevertheless  it has taken the community a long time to fully support arbitrary nesting of skeletons  mainly because of the scheduling and type verification difficulties  The trend is clear that recent skeleton frameworks support full nesting of skeletons        File Access    is the capability to access and manipulate files from an application  In the past  skeleton programming has proven useful mostly for computational intensive applications  where small amounts of data require big amounts of computation time  Nevertheless  many distributed applications require or produce large amounts of data during their computation  This is the case for astrophysics  particle physics  bio informatics  etc  Thus  providing file transfer support that integrates with skeleton programming is a key concern which has been mostly overlooked        Skeleton Set    is the list of supported skeleton patterns  Skeleton sets vary greatly from one framework to the other  and more shocking  some skeletons with the same name have different semantics on different frameworks  The most common skeleton patterns in the literature are probably farm  pipe  and map      class  wikitable  border  1     Non object oriented Algorithmic Skeleton

1472|Alias  command |  Lowercase     unref date August 2010   In computing     alias    is a   Command  computing  command   in various   command line interpreter  s    Shell  computing  shells    such as   Unix shell  s    4DOS     4NT   and   Windows PowerShell    which enables a replacement of a word with another string  It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command  or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command    An alias will last for the life of the shell session  Regularly used aliases can be set from the shell s configuration file       cshrc   or the systemwide    etc csh cshrc   for csh  or      bashrc   or the systemwide    etc bashrc   or    etc bash bashrc   for bash  so that they will be available upon the start of the corresponding shell session  The alias commands may either be written in the config file directly or   source  command  source  d from a  separate file  typically named  alias  or  alias bash   alias csh  etc   if  multiple shells  may be used      Creating aliases    Aliases can be created by supplying name value pairs as arguments for the alias command  An example of the   Bash  Unix shell  Bash   shell syntax is    alias copy  cp   The corresponding syntax in the   C shell   or   tcsh   shell is    alias copy  cp   This alias means that when the command  code copy  code  is read in the shell  it will be replaced with  code cp  code  and that command will be executed instead   In the 4DOS 4NT shell the following syntax is used to define  code cp  code  as an alias for the 4DOS  code copy  code  command    alias cp copy  To create a new alias in Windows PowerShell  the  code new  code  verb can be used with the  code alias  code  cmdlet    new alias ci copy item  This creates a new alias called  code ci  code  that will be replaced with the  code copy item  code  cmdlet when executed     History    In Unix  aliases were introduced in the   C shell   and thus survive in descendent shells such as   tcsh   and   Bash  Unix shell  bash     C shell aliases were strictly limited to one line in a shell language where all complex constructs required more  but still useful for creating simple shortcut commands   Aliases were absent from the   Bourne shell    which had the more powerful facility of functions   The alias concept was imported into   Bash  Unix shell  Bourne Again Shell    bash  and the   Korn shell    ksh   Shells such as these  that support both functions and aliases  recommend using functions where possible  Cases where aliases are necessary include the use of chained aliases  bash and ksh      Viewing currently defined aliases    To view defined aliases the following commands can be used    alias            Used without arguments  displays a list of all current aliases  alias  p         Analogous to the above  not available in 4DOS 4NT and PowerShell  alias   myAlias      Displays the command for a defined alias    Overriding aliases    In Unix shells  if an alias exists for a command  it is possible to override the alias by surrounding the command with quotes or prefixing it with a backslash  For example  consider the following alias definition    alias ls  ls  la   To override this alias and execute the  code ls  code  command as it was originally defined  the following syntax can be used     ls   or    ls  In the 4DOS 4NT shell it is possible to override an alias by prefixing it with an asterisk   For example  consider the following alias definition    alias dir    dir  2 p  The asterisk in the 2nd instance of  code dir  code  causes the unaliased  code dir  code  to be invoked  preventing recursive alias expansion  Also the user can get the unaliased behaviour of  code dir  code  at the command line by using the same syntax     dir    Changing aliases    In Windows PowerShell  the  code set  code  verb can be used with the  code alias  code  cmdlet to change an existing alias    set alias ci cls  The alias  code ci  code  will now point to the  code cls  code  command   In the 4DOS 4NT shell  the  code eset  code  command provides an interactive command line to edit an existing alias    eset  a cp  The  code  a  code  causes the alias  code cp  code  to be edited  as opposed to an environment variable of the same name     Removing aliases    In Unix shells and 4DOS 4NT  aliases can be removed by executing the  code unalias  code  command    unalias copy            Removes the copy alias  unalias  a              The  a switch will remove all aliases  not available in 4DOS 4NT  unalias                 4DOS 4NT equivalent of  unalias  a    wildcards are supported  In Windows PowerShell  the alias can be removed from the alias   drive using  code remove item  code     remove item alias ci    Removes the ci alias    Features      Chaining     An alias usually replaces just the first word   But some shells  such as  tt bash  tt  and  tt ksh  tt  allow a sequence or words to be replaced  this particular feature is unavailable through the function mechanism   The usual syntax is to define the first alias with a trailing space character  For instance  using the two aliases    alias list  ls          note the trailing space to trigger chaining  alias long   Flas       options to ls for a long listing  allows    list long myfile        becomes  tt ls  Flas myfile  tt  when run  for a long listing  where  long  is also checked for being an alias      Quoting quotes     To define an alias with single quotes  which itself needs to contain single quotes  you need to use several concatenated quoted strings  For example  to define an alias which would do    pre perl  pe  s       foo  1 bar     pre   You cannot do   pre alias foo2bar  perl  pe   s       foo  1 bar        WRONG  backslashes do not escape the next character inside single quotes  pre   But you can use single quotes quoted inside double quotes   pre alias foo2bar  perl  pe      s       foo  1 bar         pre   See  http   stackoverflow com questions 1250079 bash escaping single quotes inside of single quoted strings 1250279 this explanation    You may also consider using a function instead of an alias     Typical aliases    Some commonly used  but deprecated  aliases in the Bash shell    alias ls  ls   color auto    use colors  alias la  ls  Fa             list all files  alias ll  ls  Fls            long listing format    alias rm  rm  i              prompt before overwrite  but dangerous  see   Rm  Unix  Rm   for a better approach   alias cp  cp  i              prompt before overwrite  same general problem as the rm   alias mv  mv  i              prompt before overwrite  same general problem as the rm     alias vi  vim                use improved vi editor  Standard aliases of Windows PowerShell include    new alias cd set location    new alias ls get childitem  new alias dir get childitem    new alias echo write output  new alias ps get process  new alias kill stop process    Alternatives    Aliases should usually be kept simple  Where it would not be simple  the recommendation is usually to use one of the following       Shell script  s  which essentially provide the full ability to create new system commands       Symbolic link  s  either in  tt  usr local bin  tt  if for all users  or in a users  tt  HOME bin  tt     directory if for personal use   This method is useful for providing an additional way of calling the command  and in some cases may allow access to a buried command function for the small number of commands that use their invocation name to select the mode of operation       Shell function  s  especially if the command being created needs to modify the internal runtime environment of the shell itself  such as environment variables   needs to change the shell s current working directory  or must be implemented in a way which guarantees they it appear in the command search path for anything but an interactive shell  especially any  safer

1474|Alias analysis|  No footnotes article date April 2009      Alias analysis    is a technique in   compiler theory    used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way  Two pointers are said to be   Aliasing  computing  aliased   if they point to the same location    Alias analysis techniques are usually classified by flow sensitivity and context sensitivity  They may determine may alias or must alias information  The term    alias analysis    is often used interchangeably with term   Pointer analysis points to analysis    a specific case     What Does Alias Analysis Do     In general  alias analysis determines whether or not separate memory references point to the same area of memory   This allows the compiler to determine what variables in the program will be affected by a statement  For example  consider the following section of code that accesses members of structures    code       p foo   1  q foo   2  i   p foo   3        code   There are three possible alias cases here    The variables p and q cannot alias   The variables p and q must alias   It cannot be conclusively determined at compile time if p and q alias or not    If p and q cannot alias  then  code i   p foo   3   code  can be changed to  code i   4  code   If p and q must alias  then  code i   p foo   3   code  can be changed to  code i   5  code   In both cases  we are able to perform optimizations from the alias knowledge  On the other hand  if it is not known if p and q alias or not  then no optimizations can be performed and the whole of the code must be executed to get the result  Two memory references are said to have a   may alias   relation if their aliasing is unknown     Performing Alias Analysis    In alias analysis  we divide the program s memory into   alias classes    Alias classes are disjoint sets of locations that cannot alias to one another  For the discussion here  it is assumed that the optimizations done here occur on a low level   Intermediate language intermediate representation   of the program  This is to say that the program has been compiled into binary operations  jumps  moves between registers  moves from registers to memory  moves from memory to registers  branches   and function calls returns      Type Based Alias Analysis    If the language being compiled is   type safe    the compiler s type checker is correct  and the language lacks the ability to create pointers referencing local variables   such as ML  Haskell  or Java  then some useful optimizations can be made  There are many cases where we know that two memory locations must be in different alias classes    Two variables of different types cannot be in the same alias class since it is a property of strongly typed  memory reference free  i e  references to memory locations cannot be changed directly  languages that two variables of different types cannot share the same memory location simultaneously    Allocations local to the current stack frame cannot be in the same alias class as any previous allocation from another stack frame  This is the case because new memory allocations must be disjoint from all other memory allocations   Each record field of each record type has its own alias class  in general  because the typing discipline usually only allows for records of the same type to alias  Since all records of a type will be stored in an identical format in memory  a field can only alias to itself   Similarly  each array of a given type has its own alias class   When performing alias analysis for code  every load and store to memory needs to be labeled with its class  We then have the useful property  given memory locations  math A i  math  and  math B j  math  with  math i j  math  alias classes  that if  math i j  math  then  math A i  math  may alias  math B j  math   and if  math i  neq j  math  then the memory locations will not alias      Flow Based Alias Analysis    Analysis based on flow  unlike type based analysis  can be applied to programs in a language with references or type casting  Flow based analysis can be used in lieu of or to supplement type based analysis  In flow based analysis  new alias classes are created for each memory allocation  and for every global and local variable whose address has been used  References may point to more than one value over time and thus may be in more than one alias class  This means that each memory location has a set of alias classes instead of a single alias class     References     cite book  author Appel  Andrew W   title Modern Compiler

1481|Alice and Bob|The names    Alice and Bob    are commonly used   placeholder name  s for archetypal characters in  fields such as   cryptography   and   physics    The names are used for convenience  for example   Alice sends a message to Bob encrypted with his public key  is easier to follow than  Party A sends a message to Party B encrypted by Party B s public key   Following the alphabet  the specific names have evolved into common parlance within these fields helping technical topics to be explained in a more understandable fashion    In   cryptography   and   computer security    there are a number of widely used names for the participants in discussions and presentations about various   protocol  cryptography  protocols    The names are conventional  somewhat self suggestive  sometimes humorous  and effectively act as   metasyntactic variable  s    In typical implementations of these protocols  it is understood that the actions attributed to characters such as Alice or Bob need not always be carried out by human parties directly  but also by a trusted automated agent  such as a computer program  on their behalf   Despite the advantage of Alice and Bob s distinct genders in reducing ambiguity  there has been little tendency to introduce inanimate parties so they could be referred by neuter pronouns     List of characters     File Public key shared

  Wells  initially a   triple jump  er and   long jump  er and crowned Scottish indoor   Long Jump   champion in 1974  began concentrating on   Sprint  running  sprint   events in 1976  In 1977 he won the   Amateur Athletic Association AAA   s Indoor   60 metres   title  and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles   Wells s big breakthrough came at the start of the 1978 season  when his times and victories began to improve  and he won the UK 100   200 metres 200   Championships  British sprinters had made little impression on the international scene  and the sight of the   Scot   winning two   gold medal  s  200 m    4 x 100 metres relay 4 x 100 m     and a   silver medal silver    100 m  at the   Commonwealth Games   in   Edmonton  Alberta      Canada    was a surprise for British athletics fans   This success continued in 1979  when he won the European Cup 200 metres in   Turin    Italy  beating the new World record holder   Pietro Mennea   on his home ground  he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres   At the start of the 1980 season  Wells won the AAA s 100 metres  then went to the   C te d Azur   to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games  Wells never used starting blocks  until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics  In Moscow  Wells qualified for the final  with a new British record 10 11 s  where he faced pre race favourite   Silvio Leonard   of   Cuba    By 60 metres the field were fading  and by 80 metres the race was between Leonard on the inside and Wells on the outside  Wells edged ahead  but Leonard drew even again  With seven metres to go Wells began an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line 3 inches before Leonard s chest in a photo finish  Afterward both Wells and Leonard set a final time of 10 25 s  but Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time  ref http   www sporting heroes net athletics heroes displayhero asp HeroID 6921  ref   The 200 m final was another close affair  Wells made up the stagger after only 50 metres  Coming out of the turn he had a two metre lead over Leonard  with Quarrie and Mennea close behind  But Mennea shifted gears in the straight until he caught Wells with 10 metres to go  Wells attempted a final dip which had brought him victory in the 100  but he fell short  and Wells won the silver medal behind Pietro Mennea  who beat him by 0 02 s  again he set a British record of 20 21 s   He went on to break a third British record  38 62 s  with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final  Following the Moscow Olympics  there was a general feeling that Wells s gold medal had been devalued by the boycott of the games  however afterwards he beat all comers after the games in Germany  which included the best American sprinters Mel Lattany  Stanley Floyd  Carl Lewis and Harvey Glance  At the end of 1980  Wells was also awarded Scottish sports personality of the year   In 1981  after a successful tour of Australia and New Zealand  Wells won the European Cup 100 metres  beating   East Germany East German     Frank Emmelmann    Wells also finished 2nd in the 200   He then demonstrated his calibre by finishing first in the  IAAF Golden sprints  in   Berlin    which was the most prominent Sprint Meeting in the World that year  Although defeated by the   France Frenchman     Hermann Panzo   in the 100  Wells dominated the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany  Jeff Phillips  Stanley Floyd  Steve Williams as well as Canada s Ben Johnson  in the 100 200  10 15 20 15  200 wind assist  Wells winning the events in an aggregate 30 30   To add to this  Wells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome  beating the American Champion and world s fastest 100m performer of the year which was 10 00 by   Carl Lewis    Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200   Afterwards  he beat the top Americans Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again  when he won a 200 in the   Memorial Van Damme   meeting in   Brussels      Belgium     In 1982  in   Brisbane  Queensland      Australia    Wells won two more   Commonwealth   titles in the 100 m  a wind assisted 10 02  and then the 200 m  and a   bronze medal   in the relay  He shared the 200 m title with   Mike McFarlane   of England in a rare   Tie  draw  dead heat     In 1983  he won his 3rd European Cup title by winning the 200 metres  beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London  and again took 2nd in the 100   He then went on and finished 4th in both the 100 200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in   Helsinki     He reached the 100 m semi finals at the   1984 Los Angeles Olympics    and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final   Wells missed most of 1985 with injury  He was not selected for the   1986 Commonwealth Games Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh   in 1986  as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials  However  in a stunning comeback  he soundly beat both Johnson and Mahorn  the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions  at   Gateshead    Wells was consequently selected for   Stuttgart   in the European championships  coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals  To add to this  he also had a victory against   Linford Christie   at   Crystal Palace National Sports Centre Crystal Palace   at the end of 1986  One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100 200 double in 1987   Wells s later career was punctuated by injury  but by competing into his mid 30s he helped to set the trend for sprinters to have longer careers   After retirement  he was a coach for the British   bobsleigh   team  His wife   Margot Wells   was also a Scottish 100 100 hurdles champion  and they are now based at   Guildford      Surrey   where she is a fitness consultant  and Allan is a systems engineer  Wells was also inducted alongside   Eric Liddell   and   Wyndham Halswelle    two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions  into the   Scottish Sports Hall of Fame    Allan currently coaches the   Bank of Scotland   specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter    Ian Mackie    Wells s personal best for the 100 metres is 10 11  and for the 200 metres is 20 21  run at the   Moscow 1980   games  and both are still Scottish records     Trivia      Trivia date August 2008   Wells featured in the video for   Belle   Sebastian   s song  I m A Cuckoo    In the mid 1980s  Allan was the first to be seen sporting cycling shorts  a precursor to the now omnipresent   Lycra   running shorts  The sight of these led to him being dubbed  Wilson of the Wizard   an athletic comic book character from a bygone age    Wells was also famous for his intense physical workouts  which included intense hill running  hops sprinting    circuit training    and the use of a   speedbag     Wells was the last white man to win an Olympic 100m final  Indeed 1980 was last time a white athlete made it to the men s 100m final   In 1979 he ran a wind assisted 10 0 in the 100 metres in Grangemouth   In 1980 he ran a wind assisted 9 2 in the 100 yards in Edinburgh   In 1982 Wells also ran a wind assisted 19 8 in the 200 metres

Shawn abandoned the Atari version as he realized the platform was dying  and reimplemented his work for the   Borland   C   and   DJGPP   compilers in 1995  Support for Borland C   was dropped in version 2 0  and DJGPP was the only supported compiler  As DJGPP was a   DOS   compiler  all games which used Allegro therefore used DOS  Around 1998  Allegro branched out into several versions  A port to   Microsoft Windows    WinAllegro  was created  and also during this time  a Unix port of Allegro  XwinAllegro  was created  These various ports were brought together during the Allegro 3 9

the current version 5 0 0  RC4   Allegro 5 is a complete redesign of the API and much of the internal operation of the library  An effort was made to make the API more consistent  and multi thread safe  By default  the library will now be hardware accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate  Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 will be rewritten to interface more seamlessly with Allegro proper and will be bundled with the default installation     Allegro X3    The unknown Allegro project called Allegro X3 which started in 2003 was to introduce two new platforms  Xbox  PS2  unfortunately the project was abandoned because of insufficient funds and other unknown matters in development     See also      Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL

 Central Eastern Alps  Green  Southern Limestone Alps  Pink  Western Limestone Alps     The    Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps       lang de Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen    or    AVE    is a division of the Eastern Alps  into 75 mountain groups and is commonly used in   mountaineering    There is a basic division into the     Northern Limestone Alps      Central Eastern Alps      Western Limestone Alps      and     Southern Limestone Alps      These four main groups are further divided into 75 sub groups      History    The Alpine Club s classification of the Eastern Alps was compiled by Franz Gra ler in 1982 and published in 1984 in the Alpine Club yearbook    Berg  84    It is based on the   Moriggl Classification  ME    by   Josef Moriggl    the General Secretary of the   German and Austrian Alpine Club    Du AV   which was first published in 1924 in the   Ratgeber f r Alpenwanderer     Guide for Alpine Walkers   2nd edition  1928   This division of the Eastern Alps established for the German speaking world  less Switzerland  was compiled by the   German Alpine Club German      Austrian Alpine Club Austrian   and   South Tyrol Alpine Club  s    The classification is used   inter alia   for the basic numbering of   Alpine Club maps        Classification system    The Eastern Alps are divided into four areas  the Northern Limestone Alps  Central Eastern Alps  Southern Limestone Alps and Western Limestone Alps  The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each  The Southern Limestone Alps have 15 groups and there are six in the Western Limestone Alps   The classification is based principally on   orographic   considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups  The Gra ler amendments of 1984 address a number of geological problems and have dropped many of Morrigl s groups  making more precise sub divisions for them in other areas  These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub division letters  New areas were added to the Western Limestone Alps  This area is one not covered by the alpine clubs and is actually a continuation of the Southern and Central Alps   Unlike the previous scheme  the   Salzburg Slate Alps   were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps because they are part of the   greywacke zone   that forms the   bedrock   of the Alps  The   Ortler Alps   and   Sobretta Gavia Group   were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps  geologically speaking  they are north of the   Periadriatic Seam   are counted as Austro alpine      Geographical characteristics     The Eastern Alps extend across six countries    Germany      Italy     Liechtenstein      Austria      Switzerland   and   Slovenia    With 57 mountain groups  Austria has the largest share  It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten  There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia  Liechtenstein shares one group   The only   four thousander   and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the   Piz Bernina   at   H he 4046    Thus the   Bernina   is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps  Next are the   Ortler Alps    whose highest peak  the   Ortler      H he 3905     is the highest mountain in South Tyrol  The third highest range is the   Glockner Group   with the highest mountain in Austria  the   Grossglockner      H he 3798     Another 22 groups reach a height of 3 000 metres  The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three thousander is the   Lech Valley Alps    whose highest summit is the   Parseierspitze      H he 3036     39 groups are over 2000 metres high  Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres and only one does not reach that mark  the   Vienna Woods    Its highest mountain  the   Sch pfl   is just    H he 893   high      See also            Liste der Gebirgsgruppen in den Ostalpen  nach AVE      detailed key      Partizione delle Alpi    the Italian

1593|Alternating finite automaton|  Unreferenced stub auto yes date December 2009   In   automata theory    an    alternating finite automaton     AFA  is a   nondeterministic finite automaton   whose transitions are divided into     existential quantification existential     and     universal quantification universal     transitions  For example  let   A   be an alternating   automaton       For an existential transition  math  q  a  q 1  vee q 2   math     A   nondeterministically chooses to switch the state to either  math q 1  math  or  math q 2  math   reading   a    Thus  behaving like a regular   nondeterministic finite automaton      For a universal transition  math  q  a  q 1  wedge q 2   math     A   moves to  math q 1  math     and     math q 2  math   reading   a    simulating the behavior of a parallel machine   Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run   tree      A   accepts a word   w    if there   exists   a run tree on   w   such that   every   path ends in an accepting state   A basic theorem tells that any AFA is equivalent to an   non deterministic finite automaton    NFA  by performing a similar kind of powerset construction as it is used for the transformation of an NFA to a   deterministic finite automaton    DFA   This construction converts an AFA with   k   states to an NFA with up to  math 2 k  math  states   An alternative model which is frequently used is the one where Boolean combinations are represented as   clauses    For instance  one could assume the combinations to be in   Disjunctive normal form Disjunctive Normal Form   so that  math     q 1     q 2 q 3      math  would represent  math q 1  vee  q 2  wedge q 3   math   The state    tt       true    is represented by  math           math  in this case and    ff       false    by  math  varnothing  math   This clause representation is usually more efficient      Formal Definition   An alternating finite automaton  AFA  is a   n tuple 6 tuple     math  S  exists   S  forall    Sigma   delta  P 0  F   math   where    math S  exists   math  is a finite set of existential states  Also commonly represented as  math S  vee   math     math S  forall   math  is a finite set of universal states  Also commonly represented as  math S  wedge   math     math    Sigma  math  is a finite set of input symbols    math    delta  math  is a set of transition   function  mathematics  functions   to next state  math  S  exists   cup S  forall    times   Sigma  cup     varepsilon       to 2  S  exists   cup S  forall    math     math   P 0  math  is the initial  start  state  such that  math P 0  in S  exists   cup S  forall   math     math   F  math  is a set of accepting  final  states such that  math F  subseteq S  exists   cup S  forall   math      Run     DEFAULTSORT Alternating Finite Automaton     Category Automata theory       Compu sci stub      bs Alterniraju i kona ni automat     hr Alterniraju i kona ni automat

   Rules   There were some main rules for AmiZilla project to be accomplished by those developers who wanted to achieve the full prize bounty  The main rule was the fact that Amizilla should be a porting of any of the Mozilla Firefox browsers into Amiga platform  and it should be an Open Source project  the code should be made freely available to any Amiga developer  and easily ported  with any obvious obliged differences  to any actually existing Amiga system such as AROS  AmigaOS 3 for   Motorola   680XX family of processors    AmigaOS 4   for PPC family of processors and MorphOS  The project should be realized in C or C   to grant an easy porting of the code on every platform  and the money had had being divided up to the winning team based on how much work each team member had effectively realized  for example if the anonymous person  Joe Developer  had realized 70  of the coding he had got 70  of the booty   The fact the project had to be multi platform  and aimed at supporting all the major Amiga operating systems at the same time was the main cause of its lack of success  No any single Amiga developer could had started coding for AmiZilla as a one man job because the effort to realize a porting of Firefox on all the Amiga systems  it should had been truly an enormous task to be accomplished  and also it was difficult to start a joined team development with various people skilled at the three main Amiga systems due to never dormant grudges that afflicted the Amiga community  that was and still is divided into three main branches  AmigaOS  AROS  MorphOS  and any branch had its loyal supporters     Results of the AmiZilla project   Despite of its apparent lack of success  the AmiZilla Bounty Project inspired many bounty systems that were created upon AmiZilla s example  It lead a great rampage in Amiga for the funding of any software project and help developers to gain a concrete  or even symbolic  amount of money to get a revenue for their efforts in creating or porting software for Amiga platforms  After AmiZilla there were created bounties for AROS  MorphOS and AmigaOS  Almost the whole AROS Operating System was created by hiring bounties  and also there are still ongoing MorphOS Bounty Projects like  http   www power2people org   Power2People    or the  Amigabounty net  for AmigaOS  etc  etc  The whole Amiga community learned from AmiZilla how to fund the programmers that still work for this computing platform and helping to develop the software that it is needed in Amiga to live on and continue any further software development for this platform     Other Firefox Projects   A separate effort to port Firefox to AmigaOS 4 was started in early 2009 and still ongoing  It is named  Project   TimberWolf

ability made the Amiga popular for many applications  and provides the ability to do   Character generator character generation   and   Computer generated imagery CGI   effects far more cheaply than earlier systems  Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers  TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions  for weather graphics and radar   advertising channels  music video production  and  desktop video   The   NewTek     Video Toaster   was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga   In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024 ref  http   www amiga hardware com showhardware cgi HARDID 863 Commodore  A2024   ref    monochrome   monitor gave Amiga a choice of various high resolution graphic modes when used with compatible graphic cards  Previous versions only supported PAL or NTSC display resolutions        Sound      The sound chip  named Paula  supports four sound channels  two for the left speaker and two for the right  with 8 bit resolution for each channel and a 6 bit volume control per channel  The analog output is connected to a low pass filter  which filters out high frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate  see   Nyquist limit     The brightness of the Amiga s power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga s low pass filter  The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness  and deactivated when dimmed  or off on older A500 Amigas   On Amiga 1000  and very first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model   the power LED had no relation to the filter s status  a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter  Paula can read directly from the system s   RAM    using direct memory access  DMA   making sound playback without CPU intervention possible   Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels  software such as     OctaMED     uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels  and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14 bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least ones   The quality of the Amiga s sound output  and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software  were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years  Third party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions  multi track direct to disk recording  multiple hardware sound channels and 16 bit and beyond resolutions  A retargetable sound API called   AHI  Amiga  AHI   was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software       Kickstart firmware       Main Kickstart  Amiga    Kickstart is the   booting bootstrap     firmware    Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of   AmigaOS   and then attempt to boot from a   bootable     volume  computing  volume    such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive   The first production Amiga  the Amiga 1000  required Kickstart to be loaded first from floppy disk into 256   kilobyte kB   of RAM reserved for this purpose  Later models generally hold Kickstart on an embedded   Read only memory ROM   chip  improving start up times  Models can be upgraded by replacing the ROM  Like the Amiga 1000  early Amiga 3000 systems loaded Kickstart from hard  or floppy  disk as the machine was launched while AmigaOS 2 0 was still in   software release cycle Beta beta   development   Several third party vendors produced switchable socket doublers to allow two ROM chips to plug into the single ROM socket on the motherboard  These became popular as later Kickstart versions caused some backwards compatibility problems with earlier Amiga software titles  The effect of these switchable doublers was a convenient   dual boot   system  with a choice of two distinct OS versions via a pre determined key sequence at reboot  or via a two way switch installed in the case  depending on the specific version installed       Peripherals     The Amiga was one of the first home computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available  As a result of this and the Amiga s audio and video capabilities the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video   Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware  such as memory expansions    SCSI   controllers  CPU boards  and graphics boards  Other upgrades include genlocks  Ethernet cards  modems  sound cards and samplers  video digitizers  USB cards  extra serial ports  and IDE controllers   The most popular upgrades were memory  SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards  These were sometimes combined into the one device  particularly on big box Amigas like the A2000  A3000 and A4000   Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32 bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the   Motorola 68020   and   Motorola 68030    almost always with 32 bit memory and usually with   floating point unit FPUs   and   Memory management unit MMUs   or the facility to add them  Later designs feature the   Motorola 68040   and   Motorola 68060    Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs  Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers   Phase5 designed the   PowerUP  accelerator  PowerUP   boards    PowerUP  accelerator  Blizzard PPC Blizzard PPC   and   PowerUP  accelerator  Cyberstorm PPC CyberStorm PPC    featuring both a 68k  a 68040 or 68060  and a PPC  603 or 604  CPU  which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time  and share the system memory   The PPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations  a powerful CPU is needed to run for example   MAME    but even decoding   JPEG   pictures and   MP3   audio was considered heavy computation at the time   It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run   Linux   on the PPC  project Linux APUS   but a PPC native Amiga OS was not available when the PPC boards first appeared   24 bit graphics cards and video cards were also available  Graphics cards are designed primarily for 2D artwork production  workstation use  and later  gaming  Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals  and processing and manipulating video   Perhaps the most famous video card in the North American market was the   NewTek   Video Toaster      This was a powerful video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments  Due to its   NTSC   only design it did not find a market in countries that used the   PAL   standard  such as in Europe  In PAL countries the   OpalVision   card was popular  although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster  Low cost   Timebase correction time base correctors  TBCs    specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market  most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards   Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200 and A4000  allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as Voodoo graphic cards    Sound Blaster   sound cards  10 100 Ethernet cards  and TV tuner cards  Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip  allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC   PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers  PCI busboards with Ethernet  sound and 3D graphics cards  and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties   Expansion boards were made by   Richmond Sound Design   that allow their   show control   and   sound design   software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances  allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio

Main Amiga software   The Amiga was a primary target for productivity and game development during the late 1980s and early 1990s  Software was often developed for the Amiga and the   Atari ST   simultaneously  since the ST had a similar CPU architecture        Technical trivialities  like how many bytes that is moved across the bus  is not all that interesting  And try to keep AmigaOS stuff

Ball    The Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its public release in 1985  The bouncing ball  or other graphical elements  has been a popular theme in computer   demo effect  s since the 1950s  when a bouncing ball demo was released for   Whirlwind  computer  Whirlwind   computers and became the primary theme for early Atari games   Pong   and   Breakout  video game  Breakout      Commodore International Commodore   released a bouncing ball demo at the 1978   Consumer Electronics Show    to illustrate the capabilities of the VIC chip  A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984  It was a real time   animation   showing a red and white spinning ball  about 1 4 screen size  bouncing up and down and casting a shadow on a wall behind it  The echoing deep Bong  sound and left right motion was added soon after the show was over  Since then  the Boing Ball became one of the most well known symbols for Amiga and compatible computers   citation needed date November 2010   Within the context of this tradition of bouncing ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show  CBS Electronics also showed a Bouncing Ball demo for the   Atari   VCS 2600  with a spinning and bouncing ball  at the same event   The 1984 Boing Ball demo was one of the very first demos shown on the Amiga  It was specifically designed to take advantage of the Amiga s custom graphics  achieving a level of speed and smoothness not previously seen on an affordable computer  The 1984 demo ran standalone as there was no official DOS operating system and Intuition was just a glint in   Robert J  Mical RJ Mical   s eye at the time  A year later this demo was converted to operate in an   Intuition  Amiga  Intuition   Screen  allowing the higher resolution Amiga Workbench screen to be dragged down to make the Boing Ball visible from behind  bouncing up above the Workbench while the Workbench remained fully active  Since the Boing Ball used almost no CPU time  only to calculate the bounce angles   animation was handled by playfield vertical and horizontal scrolling tricks  the rotation animation was done with   color cycling   in the graphics chip  and of course the sound chip handled the sound   this made a particularly impressive demonstration of multitasking at the time   The Boing Ball itself was never officially adopted as a   trademark   by   Commodore International Commodore    The official Amiga trademark was a rainbow colored double   checkmark    ref

1714|AmigaBASIC|  Image AmigaBASIC png right thumb 300px AmigaBASIC running the  Demo  program      AmigaBASIC    was an   Interpreter  computing  interpreted     BASIC     programming language   implementation for the   Amiga    designed and written by   Microsoft     AmigaBASIC shipped with   AmigaOS   versions 1 1 to 1 3  It succeeded Metacomco s   ABasiC    which was included in AmigaOS 1 0 and 1 1  and it was replaced with   ARexx    a   REXX   style scripting language  from AmigaOS version 2 0 onwards     History and description    AmigaBASIC provided not only the common BASIC language  but also attempted to provide an easy to use   API   for the Amiga s unique graphics and sound capabilities  OBJECT commands  for example  made it easy to create moving objects     Sprite  computer graphics  sprites   and bobs that could be drawn with an external drawing program    Object editor    that was supplied with AmigaBASIC  An unusual feature of the language is that it theoretically allowed the calling of handwritten   assembly language   subprograms  however  this feature never worked because of a bug that failed to align the assembly language instructions correctly on a   word  computing  word   boundary  as required by the Amiga s native   MC68000   processor       Compute       a popular computer magazine published while AmigaBASIC was still being shipped  included many AmigaBASIC programs in their articles     Compute    readers could type the source code into the AmigaBASIC editor to add new software to their Amiga   The source code listings were typically implementations of simple programs  such as rudimentary games  analog clocks and address books   Many of today s successful computer programmers got their start on AmigaBASIC  including a few that work at Valve Software  the company that makes the Half Life series of games    Citation needed date February 2007    AmigaBASIC itself was rendered obsolete by being incompatible with AmigaOS 2 0 and also hardware based on successors to the   Motorola 68000   CPU due to its neglect of some programming guidelines set forth by Commodore  However  there were a number of third party compiled BASIC languages released for the Amiga that could compile AmigaBASIC programs with minimal changes  like A C BASIC or Cursor  see below   Some of these compiled BASICs continued to work with AmigaOS 2 0  and as they were compiled rather than interpreted  generally ran much faster than the original   Although AmigaBASIC was superseded by ARexx in AmigaOS 2 0  the two languages had very different functions and capabilities  Hobbyist programmers had changed by the time of this release and were more likely to be interested in incorporating existing third party applications into their programs than in writing new programs entirely from scratch  ARexx was seen as better fitting their needs than the older BASIC interpreter     Hello World in AmigaBASIC     pre    Hello World for AmigaBASIC PRINT  Hello world     pre  You can go one better by adding the following line   pre  SAY TRANSLATE    HELLO WORLD     pre  The Amiga will then say  Hello world  using   speech synthesis   in addition to displaying it on screen     Other BASIC languages for AmigaOS       Metacomco     ABasiC   was a non Microsoft Basic that was shipped with Amiga 1000 systems with Workbench 1 0  before AmigaBasic was available   ABasiC provided a more traditional Basic programming environment  requiring numbered lines and lacking support for   Intuition  Amiga  Intuition   windowing   ABasiC did provide very good support for Amiga graphics and sound features otherwise  however      ACE BASIC Compiler ACE   was an AmigaBASIC compiler  written by David Benn  The compiler produced   Motorola 68000     assembly language   which could be assembled and linked into native Amiga executables   The primary benefits were performance  lower run time memory requirements  the ability to execute software without AmigaBASIC  and the ability to distribute software without having to release the actual source code   ACE also provided additional language constructs to expand upon the capability of the AmigaBASIC language    A C Basic by Absoft was a compiler for AmigaBASIC programs that turned them into native executables that could be run without AmigaBASIC or the program s source code being present       Cursor    was another AmigaBASIC editor and compiler      GFA BASIC    originally developed for the   Atari ST    was ported to the Amiga platform by its author    Frank Ostrowski        HiSoft BASIC   was another BASIC variant ported from the Atari ST to the Amiga      AMOS  programming language  AMOS BASIC    developed by   Fran ois Lionet    was a commercial language which provided extensive support for the Amiga s graphics hardware and was designed primarily for games programming  It was used to write several commercial games and educational software      Blitz BASIC   was a direct commercial competitor to AMOS  published by   Acid Software    Like AMOS  it was targeted at games programming  Its successor  Blitz Basic 2  was used to write several commercial games  including the popular   Team17   game   Worms  computer game  Worms       References      Amiga Basic by   Paul Fellows    published by   Dabs Press    December 1992  ISBN 9781870336871   Amiga Basic

during its two decades of history       Versions 1 0 to 1 4       Image Amiga Workbench 1 0 png thumb 200px Amiga Workbench 1 0  1985      The first AmigaOS was introduced in 1985 and developed by   Commodore International    It was nicknamed   Workbench  AmigaOS    Workbench     from the name of its   Graphical user interface    GUI   due to an error of Commodore Marketing and Sales Department  which labeled the OS disk just with the name  Workbench Disk  and not with the correct name  AmigaOS Disk  Workbench    The first versions of AmigaOS  1 0 and up to 1 3  are here indicated with the name of their original disks to preserve original custom   Kickstart Workbench 1 4 was a   Software testing Beta testing beta   version of the upcoming 2 0 update and never released  but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early   Amiga 3000   computers  where it is often referred to as the    Superkickstart   ROM   In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system  The appearance of a very early first release of 1 4 was similar to 1 3  but with colors slightly changed  A second version was similar to that of 2 0 and higher  with just minor differences  It is  however  possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget  This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1 4 using either the wb 2 x  partition  or from a floppy     File Wb 20 png thumb 200px Amiga Workbench 2 0  1990          Versions 2 0 to 3 1     Workbench 2 0 improvements introduced a lot of major advances to the GUI of Amiga operating system  The blue and orange colour scheme was replaced with a grey and light blue with 3D aspect in the border of the windows  The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640 256  PAL  or 640 200  NTSC  display modes  and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier  For the first time  a standardised  look and feel  was added  This was done by creating the   Amiga Style Guide    and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software  Technologies included the GUI element creation library   gadtools    the software installation scripting language   Installer    and the     AmigaGuide     hypertext help system       Versions 3 5 and 3 9

the later owners of the Amiga trademark granted a license to a German company called   Haage   Partner   to update the Amiga s operating system  Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga s operating system  Rather than specifying  Kickstart  or  Workbench   the updates were most often referred to as simply  AmigaOS   Whereas all previous OS releases were Motorola 68000 compatible  some OS components from release 3 5 onwards required a 68020 or better       Versions 4 0 and 4 1     Eventually Amiga Inc  contracted Hyperion Entertainment to develop the   PowerPC

 it acts like any other disk  and stores files and data in memory rather than on your actual hard drive  The RAM disk is dynamically resizable and takes up only as much of your memory as it needs to  It can be used as a temporary store for your own purposes or as a place for software installers to put temporary files  and is cleared out at reboot so you won t be cluttering up your computer with thousands of unnecessary files that bog down your system  Additionally there is an optional    RAD disk     a recoverable version of the RAM disk  which preserves contents after a reboot  ref  http

computers         Image AmigaOne Micro A1 png thumb Teron Mini   AmigaOne Micro A1   motherboard       AmigaOne    is a series of   computer platform    intended to run   AmigaOS     AmigaOS 4 0 version 4 0   created by   Hyperion Entertainment    Earlier models were produced by   Eyetech    and were based on the   Teron   series of   PowerPC   POP   Motherboard mainboards    In January 2010    A Eon Technology   announced a new computer  the   AmigaOne X1000    which they have claimed will feature a dual core PowerPC motherboard  and is also intended to run AmigaOS 4 x   It has been announced that the forthcoming AmigaOne X1000 will be distributed by AmigaKit     History   Originally  AmigaOne was the name of a project for new   Amiga   hardware  managed by   Eyetech   and designed by the German company Escena GmbH  The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models  the AmigaOne 1200 and the AmigaOne 4000  It was to have connectors for an optionally attached   Amiga 1200   or an   Amiga 4000   respectively  in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga  This AmigaOne project was cancelled in 2001  mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable   Northbridge  computing  northbridge   chip   After the Escena design was abandoned  Eyetech sought an alternative solution  The result was that in 2002 they decided to use the   Teron CX   PowerPC evaluation motherboard for a product named  AmigaOnepointfive  which eventually became the AmigaOne SE  Later  the   Teron PX   motherboard was marketed by Eyetech as the Amiga One XE  followed by the Teron Mini which was marketed as Micro A1  also known as   A1   The Teron is based on   IBM   s PowerPC Open Platform specification  and uses the U Boot firmware   The main difference between the   ATX   format AmigaOne SE and XE was that the AmigaOne SE had a soldered on 600 MHz   PowerPC G3 PowerPC 750CXe PowerPC 750CXe   processor  whereas the AmigaOne XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard  While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the   Apple Inc  Apple     Power Mac G4   CPU daughtercard connector  it is not electrically compatible  There were   PowerPC G3 G3   and   PowerPC G4 G4   options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz  The G4 module originally used a Freescale   PowerPC G4 PowerPC 7450  22Voyager 22 2F 22V 27ger 22 7451   processor which was later changed to a Freescale   PowerPC G4 PowerPC 7445 2F7455  22Apollo 6 22 7455    both without level 3 cache  The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines  Consequently  the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz  In 2007 Acube offered 1 267 GHz 7457 See below   The last Teron motherboard used by Eyetech was the Teron Mini series of motherboards  which were somewhat similar to the Teron PX but made in a   Mini ITX   formfactor and with some additions  such as onboard graphics  and a better   PowerPC G3 PowerPC 750GX 750GX   CPU  The Micro A1 was announced in two configurations  under the Micro A1 I  Industrial  and Micro A1 C  Consumer  labels  Only the C configuration was produced   Both AmigaOneG3 XE and AmigaOneG4 XE have four 32 bit PCI slots  3x 33 MHz  1x 66 MHz  and one AGP 2x slot  The Micro A1 has only one 32 bit PCI slot and an integerated Radeon 7000 via AGP with dedicated 32 MB VRAM   When the AmigaOne boards first became available  OS4 was not ready  they were supplied with various Linux distributions  From April 2004 onwards  boards were shipped with a  developer prerelease  version of OS4   The full version of OS4 was launched in early 2007 for AmigaOne computers only  with the   PowerUP  accelerator  PowerUP   version being released in December 2007    AmigaOS 4 1   for AmigaOne has been released on September 2008     Models and variants     class  toccolours  align  center  border  1  cellpadding  4  style  border collapse collapse   align

mathcal H  0    operatorname span    x rangle  in  mathbf B         chi x    0    math    Given a  normalized  state vector  math   psi rangle  in  mathcal H   math  which has nonzero overlap with both subspaces  we can uniquely decompose it as    math   psi rangle   a   psi 1 rangle    b   psi 0 rangle  math   where  math   psi 1 rangle  math  and  math   psi 0 rangle  math  are the normalized projections of   math   psi rangle  math  into the subspaces  math  mathcal H  1  math  and  math  mathcal H  0  math   respectively  and  math 0   a   1  math   This decomposition defines a two

entirely in one of the subspaces          The probability of finding the system in a   good   state when measured is  math a 2  math   Furthermore we have  math a 2 b 2 1  math    Define a unitary

  psi 1 rangle   S  psi   psi 1 rangle    2ab  psi 0 rangle   1 2a 2   psi 1 rangle  math   By defining  math  theta     arcsin a        math    math 0    theta    pi 2       math   we can clearly see that in this subspace  math Q  math  corresponds to a rotation by the angle  math 2 theta      math     math Q    begin pmatrix   cos 2 theta     sin 2 theta      sin 2 theta     cos 2 theta   end

After  math n  math  iterations the probability of finding the system in a   good   state is  math  sin 2  2n 1  theta       math   br   The probability is maximized if we choose   math n    left lfloor frac  pi  4 theta  right rfloor  math   Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the   good   states  hence the name of the technique      Applications     Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements  and an oracle function  math  chi  math  which can recognize the   good   entries we are searching for   If there are G such entries in the database in total  then we can find them by initializing the quantum computer into a uniform superposition   math   psi rangle    frac 1   sqrt N    sum  k 0   N 1   k rangle  math  of all the database elements  and running the above algorithm  In this case the overlap of the initial state with the   good   subspace is equal to the frequency of the   good   entries in the database   math a 2   G N  math   If  math a  ll 1  math   we can approximate the number of required iterations as   math n    left lfloor frac  pi  4 theta  right rfloor    left lfloor frac  pi  4  arcsin a   right rfloor  approx  left lfloor frac  pi  4 a  right rfloor    left lfloor frac  pi  4   sqrt  frac N  G   right rfloor   O  sqrt N      math  Measuring the state will now give one of the   good   entries with a high probability  Since each iteration requires a single oracle query  we can find a   good   entry with just  math O  sqrt N    math  oracle queries  thus obtaining a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm   If we set G to one  the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search      References      reflist      Quantum computing      DEFAULTSORT Amplitude

1787|Analogical models|   Analogical models    are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world  often called the  target system  by another  more understandable or analysable system  They are also called    dynamical analogies         Explanation       Analogy Analogizing   is the process of representing information about a particular subject  the analogue or source system  by another particular subject  the target system    A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy   Analogical models  also called  analog  or  analogue  models  therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world  It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and or faster than the target system so that one can deduce     a priori and a posteriori  philosophy  a priori       knowledge   of target system behaviour  Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour  Truit and Rogers  p  1 3      cquote dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical  mechanical  acoustical  magnetic and electronic systems    Olson 1958  p  2     For example  in analog electronic circuits  one can use   voltage   to represent an arithmetic quantity    operational amplifier  s might then represent the arithmetic operations  addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  Through the process of   calibration   these smaller bigger  slower faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system  and are therefore called analogs of the target system  Once the calibration has taken place  modellers speak of a   one to one correspondence in behaviour   between the primary system and its analog  Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one       This doesn t seem right  Is the  model  the  target system  or the  analogue source system   It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh         Creating an analogical model     Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model  A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations  For instance  the   Phillips Hydraulic Computer   used the flow of water to model economic systems  the target system   electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems  When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of   simulation         EXAMPLES WE NEED EXAMPLES          Mechanical analogies       Needs to be filled       Empty section date July 2010     Hydraulic analogy     In an   hydraulic   analogy  a   water integrator   might be used to perform the mathematical operation of   Integral integration       Physiological analogies      Francis Crick   used the study of the   visual system   as a proxy for the study of   awareness       Formal analogies       Needs to be filled      The same   equation  s have the same   solution  s        Richard Feynman     For example  the inverse square laws of   gravitation   and   electromagnetism   can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis  almost without regard to the physical details about   mass  es and   charge  physics  charges        Recursion   requires  a similarity within a situation  for example    Archimedes   used the   myriad   to count the   The Sand Reckoner number of grains of sand on a beach   by using the concept of myriad myriads      Dynamical analogies    Arising from his pioneering work in the field of acoustical engineering research  in 1958  pp  27 29  Dr    Harry F  Olson   published a book of   Dynamics

where water represents the mobile sea of charge within metals  where pressure difference is analogy for   Voltage    and where water s flow rate is an analogy for   Electric current         Analogue computers      Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful  Electronic circuit instruments called   analog computers   were used to speed up circuit construction time  However analog computers like the   norden bombsight   could also consist of  gears and pulleys in calculation   Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published  An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid   1972  Chpt 11  pp  105 121   Elmore and Sands  1949  who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project  however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons   and   Howard T  Odum    1994  who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere     Philosophical conundrum   The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties  As noted in the  http   setis library usyd edu au stanford entries models science  ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy   there is the question of how the physical biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system  We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system  However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system  and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being  as in the case of the geobiosphere  it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their life time     Quotation     Good mathematicians see

1816|Analytical stereoplotter|  Image alpha2000 jpg thumb right 350px Alpha 2000 analytical stereoplotter      With the introduction of computers  the    analytical stereoplotter    became a popular machine of choice   photogrammetry   in the late 1960 s to 1970 s  A   stereoplotter   is an instrument that uses stereo photographs to determine elevations for the purpose of creating contours on   Topographic map topographic maps    Computers brought the capability to execute more precise calculations that ensure additional accurate output instead of approximations  This innovation also allowed a shift to a digital format rather than paper  Analytical stereoplotters edged out their analog predecessors and became the primary method of acquiring   elevation   data from   Stereoscopy stereo photographs        Projection system     Analytical stereoplotters use a math projection based on the   Collinearity equation co linearity    two vectors pointing in the same direction  equation model  The mechanical element of the device is a very accurate computer controlled instrument that can view two photographs at the same time  The measurement system can be made to create a very precise and accurate measurement for images because the photo stages only move via the x and y   Coordinates  geographic  coordinates   that are programmed into the system  In comparison  to the analytical stereoplotter  the Kelsh stereoplotter was built with a fixed focal distance and   focal length   of lens for projection  The ratio for scale was also fixed  On the other hand  the analytical stereoplotter has no substantial limitations on focal length or   Map scale scale        Viewing System     The analytical stereoplotters viewing system has an optical train system  which usually includes the ability to change the focal length of a camera by adjusting the lens  Style  size and color of the measuring mark can be adjusted in viewing system as well  There is also an illumination adjustment to each eye      Measuring and Tracing System     The analytical stereoplotter measuring system is made up of an input device for the operator to move the elevation point in three dimensions  The input device is programmed  and the digital measure of the elevation point deviation is sent to the computer  With this information  the program then is able to set and locate points for both the interior and exterior of the elevation and record measurements  The transfer of information is immediate and thus the person operating the machine is able to make any necessary adjustments to the coordinates    Elevations are measured in three steps  that include first measuring the interior orientation  then the relative orientation  and finally the absolute orientation  Interior orientation photographs are placed in relation to the center of the stereoplotter by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph  The focal length of the camera is also set  With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were the stereo photo is taken programmed in the stereoplotter  This allows the effects of parallax  distortion of the final stereo photo  to be reduced  In absolute orientation  the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model  You can use this to get the x  y  or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs  This information can be used for the construction of    Contour line contour lines   for topographic maps      Examples of Analytical Stereoplotters      Galileo Digicart   Intergraph Intermap   Kern  now Leica  DSR series  Wild  now Leica  AC and BC series   Zeiss Planicomp P series  Matra Traster series     See also        Leica Photogrammetry Suite      Orthophoto      Photogrammetry      Photomapping      Topographic map      U S  Geological Survey       References     History pdf History of Photogrammetry   http   www ferris edu faculty burtchr sure340 notes    Brown  Kent D   2004  Digital Mapping Techniques  04  Workshop Proceedings  U S  Geological Survey Open File Report 2004 1451  Photogrammetry Methods at the Utah Geological Survey  From Field Mapping to Published Map  http   pubs usgs gov of 2004 1451 brown index html    Mayo  W  Viewed on Nov  13  2007  Basic Course on producing maps from Aerial Photography  http   www b 29s over korea com aerial 20photography aerial 20photography pg3 html     External links        http   www isprs org  International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing     http   www asprs org  American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing     http   www usgs gov United States Geological Survey    Category Cartography     Category Geographic information systems      Category Photography equipment

1827|Ancient Egyptian multiplication|  unreferenced date September 2010   In   mathematics       ancient Egyptian multiplication     also known as    Egyptian multiplication        Ethiopian multiplication        Russian multiplication     or    peasant multiplication      one of two multiplication methods used by scribes  was a systematic method for multiplying two numbers that does not require the   multiplication table    only the ability to multiply and   division by 2 divide by 2    and to   addition add    It decomposes one of the   multiplicand  s  generally the larger  into a sum of   powers of two   and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand  This method may be called    mediation and duplation     where   division by two mediation   means halving one number and duplation means doubling the other number  It is still used in some areas   The second   Egyptian multiplication and division   technique was known from the   hieratic     Moscow Mathematical Papyrus Moscow   and   Rhind Mathematical Papyrus Rhind Mathematical Papyri   written in the seventeenth century B C  by the scribe   Ahmes        The decomposition     The decomposition into a sum of powers of two was not intended as a change from base ten to base two  the   Egyptians   then were unaware of such concepts and had to resort to much simpler methods  The   ancient Egypt  ians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two so as not to be obliged to recalculate them each time   The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up   The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number   For the decomposition  they proceeded methodically  they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question  subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained    The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics    To find the largest power of 2 keep doubling your answer starting with number 1  br   Example  br   br  1 x 2   2 br  2 x 2   4 br  4 x 2   8 br  8 x 2   16 br  16 x 2   32  br   Example of the decomposition of the number 25    the largest power of two less than or equal to 25 is 16    25   16   9    the largest power of two less than or equal to 9 is 8    9   8   1    the largest power of two less than or equal to 1 is 1    1   1   0  25 is thus the sum of the powers of two  16  8 and 1      The table    After the decomposition of the first multiplicand  it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand  generally the smaller  from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition   In the table  a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two   For example  if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16  and the second multiplicand is 7  the table is created as follows    1  7   2  14   4  28   8  56   16  112     The result    The result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand   The main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition  subtraction  and multiplication by two      Example    Here  in actual figures  is how 238 is multiplied by 13   The lines are multiplied by two  from one to the next   A check mark is placed by the powers of two in the decomposition of 13      border  0                1    238              2    476               4    952               8    1904          colspan  8     hr               13    3094     Since 13   8   4   1  distribution of multiplication over addition gives 13   238    8   4   1    238   8 x 238   4   238   1   238   1904   952   238   3094      See also       Egyptian mathematics      Multiplication algorithm  s    Binary numeral system      Egyptian multiplication and division       External links       http   mathforum org dr math faq faq peasant html Russian Peasant Multiplication     http   www lafstern org matt col3 pdf The Russian Peasant Algorithm  pdf file      http   www cut the knot org Curriculum Algebra PeasantMultiplication shtml Peasant Multiplication  from   cut the knot      http   ahmespapyrus blogspot com 2009 01 ahmes papyrus new and old html  New and Old classifications of Ahmes Papyrus    http   demonstrations wolfram com EgyptianMultiplication  Egyptian Multiplication  by Ken Caviness    The Wolfram Demonstrations Project       http   thedailywtf com Articles Programming Praxis Russian Peasant Multiplication aspx Russian Peasant Multiplication  at   The Daily WTF      number theoretic algorithms      Category Multiplication     Category Number theoretic algorithms      de Russische Bauernmultiplikation     es multiplicaci n por duplicaci n     fr Technique de multiplication dite russe     fr Technique de la multiplication en  gypte antique     pt Multiplica  o por duplica  o     sr

them   probability theory      topology      intuitionistic logic      turbulence      classical mechanics   and   computational complexity       Biography      Early life    Kolmogorov was born at   Tambov   in 1903  His unwed mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his aunts in   Tunoshna   near   Yaroslavl   at the estate of his grandfather  a wealthy nobleman  His father  an   agronomist   by trade  was deported from   Saint Petersburg   for participation in the revolutionary movement  He disappeared and was presumed to have been killed in the   Russian Civil War      Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt s village school  and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school newspaper  As an adolescent he designed   perpetual motion   machines  concealing their  necessary  defects so cleverly that his secondary school teachers could not discover them  In 1910  his aunt adopted him and then they moved to Moscow  where he went to a   Gymnasium  school  gymnasium    graduating from it in 1920    In 1920  Kolmogorov began to study at the   Moscow State University   and the Chemistry Technological Institute    Kolmogorov gained a reputation for his wide ranging erudition   As an undergraduate  he participated in the seminars of the Russian historian S V  Bachrushin  and he published his first research paper on the   Landowner landholding   practices in the   Novgorod Novgorod Republic   in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  ref David Salsburg    The Lady Tasting Tea  How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century    New York  W  H  Freeman  2001  pp  137 ndash 50   ref  At the same time  1921 ndash 1922   Kolmogorov derived and proved several results in   set theory   and in the theory of   Fourier series    trigonometrical series       Maturity    In 1922 Kolmogorov constructed a   Convergence of Fourier series Fourier series that diverges     almost everywhere    gaining international recognition  Around this time he decided to devote his life to   mathematics    In 1925 Kolmogorov graduated from    Moscow State University    and began to study under the supervision of   Nikolai Luzin    He made lifelong friends with   Pavel Alexandrov   who involved Kolmogorov in 1936 in an ugly  political persecution of their common teacher  the so called   Luzin case   or   Luzin affair    Kolmogorov  together with   Khinchin A  Khinchin    became interested in   probability theory    Also in 1925  he published his famous work in   intuitionistic logic    mdash    On the principle of the excluded middle    In 1929 Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree    Ph D     at the   Moscow State University     In 1930  Kolmogorov went on his first long trip abroad  traveling to   G ttingen   and   Munich    Germany  and then to Paris  France  His pioneering work   About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory   was published  in German  in 1931  Also in 1931  he became a professor at Moscow University  In 1933  Kolmogorov published the book    Foundations of the Theory of Probability    laying the modern axiomatic   probability axioms foundations of probability theory   and establishing his reputation as the world s leading living expert in this field  In 1935  Kolmogorov became the first chairman of probability theory at the   Moscow State University    In 1939  he was elected a full member  academician  of the   Russian Academy of Sciences USSR Academy of Sciences    In a 1938 paper  Kolmogorov  established the basic theorems for smoothing and predicting stationary   stochastic processes      a paper that would have major military applications during the   Cold War   to come  ref Salsburg  p  139   ref  Around the same years  1936  Kolmogorov contributed to the field of ecology and generalized the   Lotka Volterra   model of   predator prey   systems    In his study of   stochastic processes    random processes   especially   Markov

influence on the field  In   classical mechanics    he is best known for the   Kolmogorov Arnold Moser theorem    first presented in 1954 at the   International Congress of Mathematicians     In 1957 he solved   Hilbert s thirteenth problem    a joint work with his student   V  I  Arnold      He was a founder of   algorithmic complexity theory    often referred to as   Kolmogorov complexity Kolmogorov complexity theory    which he began to develop around this time     Kolmogorov was married to Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942  He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life  not only at the university level but also with younger children  as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children  in literature  and in music  as well as in mathematics  At the Moscow State University  Kolmogorov occupied different positions  including the heads of several departments    probability      statistics    and   random process  es    mathematical logic    and he also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics   In 1971  Kolmogorov joined an   Oceanography oceanographic   expedition aboard the research vessel    Dmitri Mendeleev     He wrote a number of articles for the     Great Soviet Encyclopedia      In his later years he devoted much of his effort to the mathematical and philosophical relationship between   probability theory   in abstract and applied areas  ref Salsburg  pp  145 ndash 7   ref   Kolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987  A quotation   Every mathematician believes he is ahead over all others  The reason why they don t say this in public  is because they are intelligent people  is attributed to him     Bibliography   A bibliography of his works appeared in   cite journal year 1989

1926|Anisotropic filtering|  Image Anisotropic compare png right thumb 400px An illustration of texture filtering methods showing trilinear MIP map texture on the left and enhanced with anisotropic texture filtering on the right     In   3D computer graphics       anisotropic filtering     abbreviated    AF     is a method of enhancing the image quality of   Texture filtering textures   on surfaces that are at   Dutch angle oblique viewing angles   with respect to the camera where the projection of the texture  not the polygon or other primitive on which it is rendered  appears to be non orthogonal  thus the origin of the word   an  for   not     iso  for   same    and  tropic  from   tropism    relating to direction  anisotropic filtering does not filter the same in every direction    Like   bilinear filtering bilinear   and   trilinear filtering   it eliminates   aliasing   effects  but improves on these other techniques by reducing blur and preserving detail at extreme viewing angles    Anisotropic   filtering is relatively intensive  primarily   memory bandwidth   and to some degree   computation  ally  though the standard   space time tradeoff   rules apply  and only became a standard feature of consumer level   graphics card  s in the late 1990s  Anisotropic filtering is now common in modern graphics hardware and is enabled either by users through driver settings or by graphics applications and video games through programming interfaces     An improvement on isotropic MIP mapping    Hereafter  it is assumed the reader is familiar with   mipmap MIP mapping     If we were to explore a more approximate anisotropic algorithm  RIP mapping  rectim in parvo  as an extension from MIP mapping  we can understand how anisotropic filtering gains so much texture mapping quality  If we need to texture a horizontal plane which is at an oblique angle to the camera  traditional MIP map minification would give us insufficient horizontal resolution due to the reduction of image frequency in the vertical axis  This is because in MIP mapping each MIP level is isotropic  so a 256   256 texture is downsized to a 128   128 image  then a 64   64 image and so on  so resolution halves on each axis simultaneously  so a MIP map texture probe to an image will always sample an image that is of equal frequency in each axis  Thus  when sampling to avoid aliasing on a high frequency axis  the other texture axes will be similarly downsampled and therefore potentially blurred   With RIP map anisotropic filtering  in addition to downsampling to 128   128  images are also sampled to 256   128 and 32   128 etc  These anisotropically downsampled images can be probed when the texture mapped image frequency is different for each texture axis and therefore one axis need not blur due to the screen frequency of another axis and aliasing is still avoided  Unlike more general anisotropic filtering  the RIP mapping described for illustration has a limitation in that it only supports anisotropic probes that are axis aligned in texture space  so diagonal anisotropy still presents a problem even though real use cases of anisotropic texture commonly have such screenspace mappings   In layman s terms  anisotropic filtering retains the  sharpness  of a texture normally lost by MIP map texture s attempts to avoid aliasing  Anisotropic filtering can therefore be said to maintain crisp texture detail at all viewing orientations while providing fast anti aliased texture filtering      Degree of anisotropy supported     Different degrees or ratios of anisotropic filtering can be applied during rendering and current hardware rendering implementations set an upper bound on this ratio  This degree refers to the maximum ratio of anisotropy supported by the filtering process  So  for example 4 1  pronounced 4 to 1  anisotropic filtering will continue to sharpen more oblique textures beyond the range sharpened by 2 1  In practice what this means is that in highly oblique texturing situations a 4 1 filter will be twice as sharp as a 2 1 filter  it will display frequencies double that of the 2 1 filter   However  most of the scene will not require the 4 1 filter  only the more oblique and usually more distant pixels will require the sharper filtering  This means that as the degree of anisotropic filtering continues to double there are diminishing returns in terms of visible quality with fewer and fewer rendered pixels affected  and the results become less obvious to the viewer  When one compares the rendered results of an 8 1 anisotropically filtered scene to a 16 1 filtered scene  only a relatively few highly oblique pixels  mostly on more distant geometry  will display visibly sharper textures in the scene with the higher degree of anisotropic filtering  and the frequency information on these few 16 1 filtered pixels will only be double that of the 8 1 filter  The performance penalty also diminishes because fewer pixels require the data fetches of greater anisotropy  In the end it is the additional hardware complexity vs  these diminishing returns  which causes an upper bound to be set on the anisotropic quality in a hardware design  Applications and users are then free to adjust this trade off through driver and software settings up to this threshold     Implementation    True anisotropic filtering probes the texture anisotropically on the fly on a per pixel basis for any orientation of anisotropy  In graphics hardware  typically when the texture is sampled anisotropically  several probes    texel  graphics  texel   samples  of the texture around the center point are taken  but on a sample pattern mapped according to the projected shape of the texture at that pixel  Each probe is often in itself a filtered MIP map sample  which adds more sampling to the process  Sixteen trilinear anisotropic samples might require 128 samples from the stored texture  as trilinear MIP map filtering needs to take four samples times two MIP levels and then anisotropic sampling  at 16 tap  needs to take sixteen of these trilinear filtered probes     Performance and optimization    The sample count required can make anisotropic filtering extremely   memory bandwidth bandwidth   intensive  Multiple textures are common  each texture sample could be four bytes or more  so each anisotropic pixel could require 512 bytes from texture memory  although   texture compression   is commonly used to reduce this  A display can easily contain over a million pixels  and the desired frame rate tends to be as high as 30 60 frames per second or more  so the texture memory bandwidth can get very high  tens to hundreds of gigabytes per second  very quickly  Fortunately  several factors mitigate in favor of better performance  The probes themselves share   cache  d texture samples  both inter  and intra pixel  Even with 16 tap anisotropic filtering  not all 16 taps are always needed  because only distant highly oblique pixel fill tends to be highly anisotropic  and such fill tends to cover small regions of the screen  and finally magnification texture filters require no anisotropic filtering

all forms of online anonymity   P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher  sender   or reader  receiver   of information  Common reasons include     The material or its distribution is illegal or incriminating   Material is legal but socially deplored  embarrassing or problematic in the individual s social world  for example  anonymity is seen as a key requirement for organizations like   Alcoholics Anonymous      Fear of retribution  against whistleblowers  unofficial leaks  and activists who do not believe in restrictions on information or knowledge    Censorship at the local  organizational  or national level   Personal privacy preferences such as preventing   Web visitor tracking tracking   or   datamining   activities  A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in  http   freenetproject org philosophy html The Philosophy Behind Freenet    Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology  The   United States     Navy   funded the original   onion routing   research that led to the development of the   Tor  anonymity network  Tor   network  which was later funded by the   Electronic Frontier Foundation   and is now developed by the non profit organization The Tor Project  Inc     Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication      General    While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech  they may also protect illegal activities not protected under some free speech laws  such as   fraud      slander and libel libel    the exchange of illegal   pornography    the unauthorized copying of copyrighted works  or the planning of criminal activities  Critics  Who date October 2009   of anonymous P2P systems hold that the advantages offered by such systems do not outweigh these disadvantages  and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech   Some  Who date October 2009   proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve authoritarian interests  Others  Who date October 2009   argue that information itself is ethically neutral  and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil  Perceptions of good and evil can also change  see   moral panic     for example  if anonymous peer to peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s  they might have been targeted for carrying information about   civil rights   or   anarchism     Easily accessible anonymous P2P networks are seen by some as a democratization of   encryption   technology

April 2010       Functioning of anonymous P2P      Anonymity and pseudonymity    Some of the networks commonly referred to as  anonymous P2P  are truly anonymous  in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers  Others are actually   pseudonymity pseudonymous    instead of being identified by their   Internet Protocol IP addresses    nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys  For example  each node in the   MUTE   network has an overlay address that is derived from its   public key cryptography public key    This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node  allowing messages to be addressed to it  In   Freenet    on the other hand  messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes  the nodes themselves are anonymous   The term   anonymous   is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult if not impossible to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node  Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity  If a node was only a receiver and did not send  then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only  removing any   plausible deniability   that it was the recipient  and consumer  of the information  Thus  in order to remain anonymous  nodes must ferry information for others on the network      Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks    Originally  anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers  As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew  malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks  This is similar to the Internet  where widespread use has been followed by waves of   spam  electronic  spam   and distributed   denial of service attack  s  Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks  For example  blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information  These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth  as has been shown in examples on the   Tor  anonymity network  Tor   network   However  a conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking  Citation needed date April 2010    Participants in the network interested in ensuring the continuous availability of it could collaborate to identify the source of abusive traffic  and further investigate or prosecute it  This could be done without compromising the anonymity of data in the network     Opennet and darknet network types     Main Friend to friend   Like conventional P2P networks  anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or   Darknet  file sharing  darknet    often named   friend to friend    network type  This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes     In opennet network  peer nodes are discovered automatically  There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers    In a darknet network  users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know  Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers   Some networks like   Freenet   support both network types simultaneously  a node can have some manually added darknet peer nodes and some automatically selected opennet peers     In a friend to friend  or F2F  network  users only make direct connections with people they know  Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another  For example  a node in a friend to friend overlay can automatically forward a file  or a request for a file  anonymously between two  friends   without telling either of them the other s name or IP address  These  friends  can in turn forward the same file  or request  to their own  friends   and so on  Users in a friend to friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends  so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users  anonymity   Some   friend to friend   networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with  friends  within the node  in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of   Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed  see   Friend to Friend   article for summary     List

1959|Anonymous internet banking|   Anonymous Internet Banking    is the name given to the proposed use of strong   financial cryptography   to make electronic   bank secrecy    or more precisely   pseudonymity pseudonymous   banking  possible  The bank issues currency in the form of electronic tokens that can be converted on presentation to the bank to some other currency  This concept has a long history in which   free banking   institutions have issued their own paper currency often backed by a physical commodity     History   Whilst the academic study of trust relationships and systems has long been the forte of   intelligence services   such as the   United States American     NSA    the growth of the internet in the   1990s   and the contemporary declassification of related knowledge allowed for greater public discussion of the potential for anonymous banking services by groups such as the   Cryptoanarchy cryptoanarchists   and   cypherpunks         Implemented systems   Examples of anonymous internet banking services and software that have already been implemented include     eCache    an anonymous bank operating over the   Tor  anonymity network  Tor   network     Bitcoin    distributed   P2P   cryptocurrency     Pecunix    an  optionally   anonymous digital gold currency     Yodelbank    an anonymous bank built on top of various digital gold currencies which ended operations during November 2005     Open Transactions    Open source software  including a library  server  and test client  implementing untraceable digital cash and anonymous numbered accounts     The underlying mathematics   Anonymous internet banking depends on the mathematics of   public key cryptography   and   blind signature   algorithms   In this simple example we have   Alice and Bob   and a banker   The banker generates an   RSA   public key with modulus  math n  P Q  math   where  math P  math  and  math Q  math  are large   Prime number primes    making  math n  math  a   semiprime     As described in   RSA Operation RSA operation    the bank also generates public key exponent  math e  math  and private key exponent  math d  math    Bob asks the banker for a  100   deposit slip   in anticipation of Alice wanting to transfer money to him   To generate a deposit slip the bank selects a large  globally unique   random number    math R  math  and encrypts it using the bank s public key  this means that it can only be decrypted with the bank s secret key    math R    R e pmod n  math   This encrypted value  math R   math  is sent to Bob with the promise to deposit  100 into his account when Bob sends the value  math R  math  back to the bank   The bank is confident that Bob won t be able to break RSA to generate  math R  math  from  math R   math  within the   heat death of the universe   without knowledge of  math d  math   so it does not worry about handing out the deposit slips without receiving anything from Bob   When Alice wants to pay Bob  100 she asks for the deposit slip and Bob sends her  math R   math    Alice selects a large random value  math w  math  coprime with  math n  math   so as to have an inverse modulo  math n  math   and uses it to   Blind signature blind    math R   w e R   math  and sends it to the bank to be   Blind signature blind signed     The Bank charges Alice  100 for this operation and returns the blind signed value  math R     math    Due to the symmetric properties of RSA  this provides her with  math R  math     math   begin align  R         w e R   d  pmod n              w e R e  d  pmod n              w R   ed   pmod n              w   R  pmod n    end align    math   Because of the blinding process  the Bank is not able to associate  math R    math  with  math R   math  or  math R  math   so it is unable to determine that Bob and Alice are doing business together  preserving the anonymity of the transaction   Alice unblinds  math R     math   by dividing it by  math w  math   to generate the original value  math R  math   which she sends to Bob  Bob verifies that  math R  math  can be encrypted with the bank s public key by computing  math R    R e  pmod n  math   which means that Alice has deposited  100 into the bank   Bob then sends this value to the bank and the bank checks its records to be sure that  math R  math  has not been already used   If it has not  it deposits  100 into his account and updates its database that the unique value  math R  math  has been redeemed   Different public keys can be used for different denominations of currency so this system doesn t take appreciably longer for large transactions   Note that if neither Alice nor Bob wishes the bank to know that they performed a transaction with each other  then it is hard for the bank to find out   However  in order to ensure this is the case many people need to be making transactions at the same time   Otherwise the bank can figure it out by the timing of the transactions  using   traffic analysis       See also      Bearer bond      Blind signature      Electronic money      Itex      Online banking      Ripple monetary system      RSA      External links     http   wiki github com

  We would like to use ASP to find an  math n  math  coloring of a given graph  or determine that it does not exist     This can be accomplished using the following Lparse program    pre  c 1  n                                              1  color X I    c I   1    v X                   color X I   color Y I   e X Y   c I     pre   Line 1 defines the numbers  math 1  dots n  math  to be colors   According to the choice rule in Line 2  a unique color  math i  math  should be assigned  to each vertex  math x  math    The constraint in Line 3 prohibits assigning the same color to vertices  math x  math  and  math y  math  if there is an edge connecting them   If we combine this file with a definition of  math G  math   such as   pre  v 1  100     1     100 are vertices e 1 55     there is an edge from 1 to 55         pre   and run smodels on it  with the numeric value of  math n  math  specified on the command line  then the atoms of the form  math color  dots  dots   math  in the output of smodels will represent an  math n  math  coloring of  math G  math    The program in this example illustrates the  generate and test  organization that is often found in simple ASP programs   The choice rule describes a set of  potential solutions     a simple superset of the set of solutions to the given search problem   It is followed by a constraint  which eliminates all potential solutions that are not acceptable   However  the search process employed by smodels and other answer set solvers is not based on   trial and error        Large clique     A   Clique  graph theory  clique   in a graph is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices   The following lparse program finds a clique of size  math  geq n  math  in a given graph  or determines that it does not exist    pre  n  in X    v X       in X   in Y   v X   v Y   X  Y  not e X Y   not e Y X     pre   This is another example of the generate and test organization   The choice rule in Line 1  generates  all sets consisting of  math  geq n  math  vertices   The constraint in Line 2  weeds out  the sets that are not cliques      Hamiltonian cycle     A   Hamiltonian cycle   in a   directed graph   is a   Path  graph theory  cycle   that passes through each vertex of the graph exactly once   The following Lparse program can be used to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a given directed graph if it exists  we assume that 0 is one of the vertices    pre   in X Y      e X Y       2  in X Y    e X Y    v X      2  in X Y    e X Y    v Y    r X     in 0 X   v X   r Y     r X   in X Y   e X Y       not r X   v X     pre   The choice rule in Line 1  generates  all subsets of the set of edges   The three constraints  weed out  the subsets that are not Hamiltonian cycles   The last of them uses the auxiliary predicate  math r x   math     math x  math  is reachable from 0   to prohibit the  vertices that do not satisfy this condition   This predicate is defined recursively in Lines 4 and 5   This program is an example of the more general  generate  define and test  organization  it includes the definition of an auxiliary predicate that helps us eliminate all  bad  potential solutions     Comparison of implementations

1990|Anti aliasing filter|An    anti aliasing filter    is a filter used before a signal sampler  to restrict the bandwidth of a signal to approximately satisfy the   sampling theorem    Since the theorem states that unambiguous interpretation of the signal from its samples is possible when the power of frequencies above the   Nyquist frequency   is zero  a real anti aliasing filter can generally not completely satisfy the theorem  A realizable anti aliasing filter will typically permit some   aliasing   to occur  the amount of aliasing that does occur depends on how good the filter is and what the frequency content of the input signal is   Anti aliasing filters are commonly used at the input of   digital signal processing   systems  for example in sound digitization systems  similar filters are used as   reconstruction filter  s at the output of such systems  for example in music players   In the later case  the filter is to prevent aliasing in the conversion of samples back to a continuous signal  where again perfect stop band rejection would be required to guarantee zero aliasing   The theoretical impossibility of realizing perfect filters is not much an impediment in practice  though practical considerations do lead to system design choices such as oversampling to make it easier to realize  good enough  anti aliasing filters      Optical anti aliasing filter      Image anti aliasing filter jpg thumb 250px Anti aliasing and IR reject filter from an older digital video camera    In the case of optical image sampling  as by   image sensor  s in   digital camera  s  the anti aliasing filter is also known as an   optical lowpass filter   or   blur filter   or   AA filter     The mathematics of sampling in two spatial dimensions is similar to the mathematics of time domain sampling  but the filter implementation technologies are different   The typical implementation in   digital camera  s is two layers of   birefringent   material such as   lithium niobate    which spreads each optical point into a cluster of four points  ref   cite book   author   Adrian Davies and Phil Fennessy   title   Digital imaging for photographers   edition   Fourth edition

output   The idea is to use a higher intermediate digital sample rate  so that a nearly ideal digital filter can sharply cut off aliasing near the original low   Nyquist frequency    while a much simpler analog filter can stop frequencies above the new higher Nyquist frequency   The purpose of oversampling is to relax the requirements on the anti aliasing filter  or to further reduce the aliasing  Since the initial anti aliasing filter is   analog circuit analog    oversampling allows for the filter to be cheaper because the requirements are not as stringent  and also allows the anti aliasing filter to have a smoother frequency response  and thus a less complex phase response   On input  an initial analog anti aliasing filter is relaxed  the signal is sampled at a high rate  and then downsampled using a nearly ideal digital anti aliasing filter      Bandpass signals      main Undersampling   Often  an anti aliasing filter is a   low pass filter    however  this is not a requirement   Generalizations of the   Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem   allow sampling of other band limited   passband   signals instead of   baseband   signals   see   undersampling     For signals that are bandwidth limited  but not centered at zero  a   band pass filter   can be used as an anti aliasing filter   For example  this could be done with a   Single sideband modulation single sideband modulated   or   frequency modulated   signal   If one desired to sample an   FM radio   broadcast centered at 87 9 MHz and bandlimited to a 200 kHz band  then an appropriate anti alias filter would be centered on 87 9   megahertz MHz   with 200 kHz bandwidth  or   pass band   of 87 8 MHz to 88 0 MHz   and the sampling rate would be no less than 400 kHz  but should also satisfy other constraints to prevent   aliasing        Signal overload      main Clipping  audio     It is very important to avoid input signal overload when using an anti aliasing filter  If the signal is strong enough  it can cause clipping at the   analog to digital converter    even after filtering  When distortion due to clipping occurs after the anti aliasing filter  it can create components outside the passband of the anti aliasing filter  these components can then alias  causing the reproduction of other non harmonically related frequencies  In   digital audio    the resulting aliased distorted signal of  digital   clipping  audio  clipping    has a characteristic sound that can be easily recognized      See also       Anti aliasing      Sample  signal       Sampling frequency

1993|Anti gravity|  redirect AntiGrav the EyeToy video game EyeToy  AntiGrav   In   physical cosmology      astronomy   and   celestial mechanics       anti gravity    is the idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of   gravity    It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in   free fall   or   orbit    nor to balancing the force of gravity with some other force  such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift   Instead  anti gravity requires that the fundamental causes of the force of gravity be made either not present or not applicable to the place or object through some kind of technological intervention  Anti gravity is a recurring concept in   science fiction    particularly in the context of   spacecraft propulsion    The concept was first introduced formally as    Cavorite    in   H  G  Wells        The First Men in the Moon      and has been a favorite item of imaginary technology since that day   In the first mathematically accurate description of gravity    Newton s law of universal gravitation    gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means  However in the early part of the 20th century Newton s model was replaced by the more general and complete description known as   general relativity    In general relativity  gravity is not a force in the traditional sense of the word  but the result of the geometry of space itself  These geometrical solutions always cause attractive  forces   Under general relativity  anti gravity is highly unlikely  except under contrived circumstances that are regarded as unlikely or impossible  The term  anti gravity  is also sometimes used to refer to hypothetical   reactionless propulsion   drives based on certain solutions to general relativity  although these do not oppose gravity as such   There are numerous newer theories that add onto general relativity or replace it outright  and some of these appear to allow anti gravity like solutions  However  according to the current generally accepted physical theories and according to the directions of physical research  there are no indications for anti gravity to be possible  ref Peskin  M and

Foundation disappeared some time after Babson s death in 1967  However  it continues to run an essay award  offering prizes of up to  5 000  As of 2007  it is still administered out of   Wellesley

theory was greatly slowed by a lack of suitable mathematical tools  Although it appeared that anti gravity was outlawed under general relativity  there were a number of efforts to study potential solutions that allowed anti gravity type effects   It is claimed the   US Air Force   also ran a study effort throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s  ref Goldberg  J  M   1992   US air force support

However there is little outside confirmation of these stories  and since they take place in the midst of the   policy by press release   era  it is not clear how much weight these stories should be given   It is known that there were serious efforts underway at the   Glenn L  Martin Company    who formed the Research Institute for Advance Study  ref Mallan  L   1958     Space satellites    How

gravitation was the creation of the Institute for Field Physics    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill    in 1956 by Gravity Research Foundation trustee  Agnew H  Bahnson   Military support for anti gravity projects was terminated by the   Mansfield Amendment   of 1973  which restricted   United States Department of Defense Department of Defense   spending to only the areas of scientific research with explicit military applications  The Mansfield Amendment was passed specifically to end long running projects that had little to show for their efforts       Negative mass     Under general relativity  gravity is the result of following a spatial geometry  change in the normal shape of space  caused by local mass energy  This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space  deformed by massive objects  that causes  gravity   which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force  Although the equations cannot produce a  negative geometry  normally  it is possible to do so using a  negative mass   The same equations do not  of themselves  rule out the existence of negative mass   Both general relativity and Newtonian gravity appear to predict that negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field  In particular  Sir   Hermann Bondi   proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass  combined with negative inertial mass  would comply with the   strong equivalence principle   of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy  Bondi s proof yielded singularity free solutions for the relativity equations  ref name  Bondi  Bondi  H   1957  July   Negative mass in general relativity    Reviews of Modern Physics       29    3   423 428   ref  In July 1988    Robert L  Forward

mass will fall toward  and not away from   normal  matter  since although the gravitational force is repulsive  the negative mass  according to Newton s law  F ma  responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force  Normal mass  on the other hand  will fall away from the negative matter  He noted that two identical masses  one positive and one negative  placed near each other will therefore self accelerate in the direction of the line between them  with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass  ref name  Bondi     Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative   kinetic energy    the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero  Forward pointed out that the self acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass  and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles  ref name  Forward      The   Standard Model   of particle physics  which describes all presently known forms of matter  does not include negative mass  Although cosmological   dark matter   may consist of particles outside the Standard Model whose nature is unknown  their mass is ostensibly known   since they were postulated from their gravitational effects on surrounding objects  which implies their mass is positive   The proposed cosmological   dark energy    on the other hand  is more complicated  since according to general relativity the effects of both its energy density and its negative pressure contribute to its gravitational effect        Fifth force     Under general relativity any form of energy couples with spacetime to create the geometries that cause gravity  A longstanding question was whether or not these same equations applied to   antimatter    The issue was considered solved in 1960 with the development of   CPT symmetry    which demonstrated that antimatter follows the same laws of physics as  normal  matter  and therefore has positive energy content and also causes  and reacts to  gravity like normal matter   For much of the later quarter of the 20th century  the physics community has been involved in an attempt to produce a   unified field theory    a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces  gravity  electromagnetism  and the strong and weak nuclear forces  Scientists have made progress in   grand unification theory unifying the three quantum forces    but gravity has remained  the problem  in every attempt  This has not stopped any number of such attempts being made  however   Generally these attempts tried to  quantize gravity  by positing a particle  the   graviton    that carried gravity in the same way that   photon  s  light  carry electromagnetism  Simple attempts along this direction all failed  however  leading to more complex examples that attempted to account for these problems  Two of these    supersymmetry   and the relativity related   supergravity    both required the existence of an extremely weak  fifth force  carried by a   graviphoton    which coupled together several  loose ends  in quantum field theory  in an organized manner  As a side effect  both theories also all but required that antimatter be affected by this fifth force in a way similar to anti gravity  dictating repulsion away from mass  Several experiments were carried out in the 1990s to measure this effect  but none yielded positive results  ref name SciAm79   Supergravity and the Unification of the Laws of Physics    by Daniel Z  Freedman and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen  Scientific American  February 1978  ref       General relativistic  warp drives      There are solutions of the field equations of general relativity which describe  warp drives   such as the famous   Alcubierre metric    and stable  traversable   wormholes    This by itself is not significant  since   any   spacetime geometry is a solution of the field equations for some configuration of the   stress energy tensor   field  see   exact solutions in general relativity     General relativity does not constrain the geometry of spacetime unless outside constraints are placed on the stress energy tensor  Warp drive and traversable wormhole geometries are well behaved in most areas  but require regions of   exotic matter    thus they are excluded as solutions if the stress energy tensor is limited to known forms of matter  Dark matter and dark energy are not understood enough at this present time to make general statements regarding their applicability to a warp drive  Many physicists such as Edmond S  Miksch of Harvard have theorized that dark matter has negative mass  There is considerable empirical evidence supporting this claim such as the results produced by Supernova Cosmology Project team in 1998  ref Choi

2024|Antisymmetry|  two other uses  the property of matrices Skew symmetric matrix the property of mathematical relations Antisymmetric relation   In   linguistics       antisymmetry    is a theory of   syntax syntactic   linearization presented in   Richard Kayne   s 1994 monograph   The Antisymmetry of Syntax    ref name  antisymmetry    cite book   author Kayne  Richard S    title The Antisymmetry of Syntax  Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Twenty Five   year   1994   publisher   MIT Press    ref  The crux of this theory is that hierarchical structure in natural language maps universally onto a particular surface linearization  namely specifier head complement   Branching  linguistics  branching order    The theory derives a version of   X bar theory    Kayne hypothesizes that all phrases whose surface order is not specifier head complement have undergone movements that disrupt this underlying order  Subsequently  there have also been attempts at deriving specifier complement head as the basic word order  ref   cite book   author Li  Yafei   title   A Theory of the Morphology Syntax Interface   year   2005   publisher   MIT Press    ref     Asymmetric c command   The theory is based on a notion of   asymmetric   c command      c command being a relation between nodes in a   tree  graph theory  tree   originally defined by   Tanya Reinhart    Kayne uses a simple definition of c command based on the  first node up   However  the definition is complicated by his use of a  segment category distinction   A category is a kind of extended node  if two directly connected nodes in a tree have the same label  these two nodes are both segments of a single category  C command is defined in terms of categories using the notion of  exclusion   A category excludes all categories not dominated by   both   its segments  A c commands B if every category that dominates A also dominates B  and A excludes B  The following tree illustrates these concepts    center   Image Antisymmetry segment category distinction png    center   AP sub 1  sub  and AP sub 2  sub  are both segments of a single category  AP does not c command BP because it does not exclude BP  CP does not c command BP because both segments of AP do not dominate BP  so it is not the case that every category that dominates CP dominates BP   BP c commands CP and A  A c commands C  The definitions above may perhaps be thought to allow BP to c command AP  but a c command relation is not usually assumed to hold between two such categories  and for the purposes of antisymmetry  the question of whether BP c commands AP is in fact moot    The above is not an exhaustive list of c command relations in the tree  but covers all of those that are significant in the following exposition      Asymmetric c command   is the relation that holds between two categories  A and B  if A c commands B but B does not c command A  This relationship is a primitive in Kayne s theory of linearization  the process that converts a tree structure into a flat  structureless  string of terminal nodes     Precedence and asymmetric c command   Informally  Kayne s theory states that if a nonterminal category A c commands another nonterminal category B  all the terminal nodes dominated by A must precede all of the terminal nodes dominated by B  this statement is commonly referred to as the  Linear Correspondence Axiom  or LCA   Moreover  this principle must suffice to establish a   complete   and   consistent   ordering of all terminal nodes  mdash  if it cannot consistently order all of the terminal nodes in a tree  the tree is illicit  Consider the following tree       NOT SURE IF THIS IS REALLY MUCH MORE INFORMATIVE SINCE IT S STILL QUITE INFORMAL The technical machinery goes as follows  In a tree with a set of pairs of categories    A i  B i    such that for all i  A i asymmetrically c commands B i  the set of terminals  a 1  a 2  a 3     a n  dominated by A i precedes the terminals  b 1  b 2  b 3     b n  dominated by B i  Crucially  a category consists of all segments of a maximal projection        center   Image Antisymmetry php basic tree structure png    center    S and S  may either be simplex structures like BP  or complex structures with specifers and complements like CP    In this tree  the set of pairs of nonterminal categories such that the first member of the pair asymmetrically c commands the second member is as follows    BP  A    BP  CP    A  CP    This gives rise to the total ordering   b  a  c    As a result  there is no right adjunction  and hence in practice no rightward movement either  ref Since any rightward movement must also be downward movement if there are no rightward specifiers or right adjunction  and downward movement is generally assumed to be illicit   ref  Furthermore  the underlying order must be specifier head complement     Derivation of X bar theory   The example tree in the   Antisymmetry Asymmetric c command first section   of this article is in accordance with   X bar theory    with the exception that  Spec CP  is treated as an adjunct   It can be seen that removing any of the structure in the tree  e g  deleting the C dominating the  c  terminal  so that the complement of A is  CP c   will destroy the asymmetric c command relations necessary for linearly ordering the terminals of the tree      The universal order   Kayne notes that his theory permits either a universal specifier head complement order or a universal complement head specifier order  depending on whether asymmetric c command establishes precedence or subsequence  S H C results from precedence   pp  35 36  ref name  antisymmetry     He argues that there are good empirical grounds for preferring S H C as the universal underlying order  since the   linguistic typology typologically   most widely attested order is for specifiers to precede heads and complements  though the order of heads and complements themselves is relatively free   He further argues that a movement approach to deriving non S H C orders is appropriate  since it derives asymmetries in typology  such as the fact that  verb second  languages such as   German language German   are not mirrored by any known  verb second from last  languages      Derived orders  the case of Japanese wh questions   Perhaps the biggest challenge for antisymmetry is to explain the wide variety of different surface orders across languages  Any deviation from Spec Head Comp order  which implies overall Subject Verb Object order  if objects are complements  must be explained by movement  Kayne argues that in some cases  the need for extra movements  previously unnecessary because different underlying orders were assumed for different languages  can actually explain some mysterious typological generalizations  His explanation for the lack of   wh movement   in   Japanese language Japanese   is the most striking example of this  From the mid 1980s onwards  the standard analysis of wh movement involved the wh phrase moving leftward to a position on the left edge of the clause called  Spec CP   i e   the specifier of the CP phrase   Thus  a derivation of the English question   What did John buy    would proceed roughly as follows     CP  Spec CP position  John did buy what      wh movement       CP What did John buy   The Japanese equivalent of this sentence is as follows ref   cite book title Introducing Transformational Grammar  Second Edition  author Jamal Ouhalla year 1999 publisher Arnold Oxford University

what     accusative case accusative       bought      question particle       Japanese has an overt  question particle     ka     which appears at the end of the sentence in questions  It is generally assumed that languages such as English have a  covert   i e  phonologically null  equivalent of this particle in the  C  position of the clause  mdash  the position just to the right of  Spec CP   This particle is overtly realised in English by movement of an   auxiliary verb auxiliary   to C  in the case of the example above  by movement of   did   to C   Why is it that this particle is on the left edge of the clause in English  but on the right edge in Japanese  Kayne suggests that in Japanese  the   whole of the clause    apart from the question particle in C  has moved to the  Spec CP  position  So  the structure for the Japanese example above is something like the following     CP  John wa nani o kaimasita    C ka    Now it is clear why Japanese does not have wh movement  mdash  the  Spec CP  position is already filled  so no wh phrase can move to it  We therefore predict a seemingly obscure relationship between surface word order and the possibility of wh movement  A possible alternative to the antisymmetric explanation could be based on the difficulty of parsing languages with rightward movement  ref Neeleman  Ad   Peter Ackema  2002    Effects of Short Term

2025|Antithetic variates|The    antithetic variates    method is a   variance reduction   technique used in   Monte Carlo methods    Considering that the error reduction in the simulated signal  using   Monte Carlo methods    has a   square root     limit of a sequence convergence      standard deviation   of the solution   a very large number of   sample   paths is required to obtain an accurate result      Underlying principle    The antithetic variates technique consists  for every   sample   path obtained  in taking its antithetic path  mdash  that is given a path  math    varepsilon 1  dots  varepsilon M    math  to also take  math     varepsilon 1  dots   varepsilon M    math   The advantage of this technique is twofold  it reduces the number of   normal   samples to be taken to generate   N   paths  and it reduces the   variance   of the sample paths  improving the accuracy    Suppose that we would like to estimate    math  theta    mathrm E   h X       mathrm E   Y        math   For that we have generated two samples     math Y 1 text  and  Y 2      math   An unbiased estimate of  math   theta   math  is given by     math  hat  theta    frac Y 1   Y 2  2     math   And    math  text Var   hat  theta     frac  text Var  Y 1     text Var  Y 2    2 text Cov  Y 1 Y 2   4    math   In the case where   Y   sub 1  sub   and   Y   sub 2  sub  are   iid      covariance   self cancels and  math  text Var  Y 1     text Var  Y 2    math   therefore     math  text Var   hat  theta     frac  text Var  Y 1    2     frac  text Var  Y 2    2     math   The antithetic variates technique consists in this case of choosing the second sample in such a way that  math Y 1  math   and   math Y 2  math  are not   iid   anymore and  math  Cov Y 1 Y 2   math  is negative  As a result   math  text Var   hat  theta   math  is reduced and is smaller than the previous normal   variance    math  frac  text Var  Y 1    2     frac  text Var  Y 2    2    math      Example 1    If the law of the variable   X   follows a   uniform distribution  continuous  uniform distribution   along  0  1   the first sample will be    math u 1   ldots  u n  math    where  for any given   i     math u i  math  is obtained from   U   0  1   The second sample is built from    math u  1   ldots  u  n  math    where  for any given   i     math u  i   1 u i  math     If the set  math u 1  math  is uniform along  0  1   so are  math u  i  math    Furthermore  covariance is negative  allowing for initial variance reduction     Example 2  integral calculation    We would like to estimate   math I    int 0 1  frac 1  1 x      mathrm d x   math   The exact result is    math I  ln 2  approx 0 69314718  math    This integral can be seen as the expected value of   math f U   math    where    math f x     frac 1  1 x   math   And   U   follows a   uniform distribution  continuous  uniform distribution    0  1    The following table compares the classical Monte Carlo estimate  sample size  2  n    where   n     1500  to  the antithetic variates estimate  sample size    n    completed with the transformed sample 1  minus    u   sub   i          cellspacing  1  border  1      align  right       Estimate      align  right       Variance           Classical Estimate     align  right    0 69365   align  right    0 02005        Antithetic Variates      align  right    0 69399   align  right    0 00063     The use of the antithetic variates method to estimate the result shows an important variance reduction     Category Computational statistics     Category Monte Carlo methods      unreferenced date November 2010  
2038|Any angle path planning|  Graph search algorithm       Any angle path planning    algorithms search for paths on a cell decomposition of a continuous   configuration space    such as a two dimensional terrain    Consider  for example  a uniform grid with blocked and unblocked cells  Searching the corresponding   visibility graph   finds a shortest path from a given start vertex to a given goal vertex but is typically very slow since the number of edges can grow quadratically in the number of vertices  Searching the corresponding   grid graph   typically finds suboptimal paths  since  for example  the heading changes of the resulting path are constrained to multiples of 45 degrees on an eight neighbor grid graph  but is fast since the number of edges grows no faster than linearly in the number of vertices  Optimizing the path after the search typically shortens the path but does not change the topology of the path  It does not find a shortest path  for example  if the path found by the search algorithm passes a blocked cell on the left but the shortest path passes the same blocked cell on the right  Thus  there is an advantage to interleaving the search and the optimization     Any angle path planning    algorithms propagate information along grid edges  to search fast  without constraining their paths to grid edges  to find short paths   Thus  the heading changes of their paths are not constrained to specific angles  which explains their name  ref name  A  Nash  K  Daniel 1183  A  Nash  K  Daniel  S  Koenig and A  Felner  Theta   Any Angle Path Planning on Grids  In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence  pages 1177 1183  2007   ref   So far  two main any angle path planning algorithms have been developed  both based on the heuristic search algorithm   A     ref P  Hart  N  Nilsson and B  Raphael  A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths  IEEE Trans  Syst  Science and Cybernetics  SSC 4 2   100 107  1968   ref      Field D     uses interpolation during each vertex expansion  ref D  Ferguson and A  Stentz  Field D   An Interpolation Based Path Planner and Replanner  Proceedings of the International Symposium on Robotics Research  2005   ref  and    Theta     checks for shortcuts during each vertex expansion  ref name  A  Nash  K  Daniel 1183    Both of them find short paths but neither one of them is guaranteed to find shortest paths     Applications       Robot navigation       Real time strategy   games    References     reflist      See also       Path planning      DEFAULTSORT Any Angle Path Planning     Category Search algorithms     Category Robotics     Category Artificial intelligence

modeling tool developed by XJ Technologies     History of AnyLogic   In the beginning of 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes  This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs  The Distributed Computer Network  DCN  research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness  the new tool was named COVERS  Concurrent Verification and Simulation   This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior  The tool was applied for the research granted by Hewlett Packard       In 1998 the success of this research inspired the DCN laboratory to organize a company with a mission to develop a new age simulation software  The emphasis in the development was placed on applied methods  simulation  performance analysis  behavior of stochastic systems  optimization and visualization  New software released in 2000 was based on the latest advantages of information technologies  an object oriented approach  elements of the UML standard  the use of Java  a modern GUI

process centric    DE     systems dynamics    SD   and   Agent based model agent based    AB      System dynamics and discrete event are traditional simulation approaches  agent based is new  Technically  the system dynamics approach deals mostly with continuous processes whereas  discrete event   by which we mean all descendants of   GPSS   also known as process centric simulation approach  and agent based models work mostly in discrete time  i e  jump from one event to another    System dynamics and discrete event simulation historically have been taught at universities to very different groups of students  namely   management   and   economy    industrial and   Operations research operation research   engineers  As a result  there are two distinct practitioners  communities that never talk to each other    Agent based modeling until recently has been mostly a purely academic topic  However  the increasing demand for global business optimization caused leading modelers looking at combined approaches to gain a deeper insight into complex interdependent processes having very different natures   How modeling approaches correspond to the abstraction levels  System dynamics dealing with aggregates is obviously used at the highest abstraction level  Discrete event modeling is used at low to middle abstraction  As for agent based modeling  this technology is used across all abstraction levels  and agent may model objects of very diverse nature and scale  at the  physical  level agents may be e g  pedestrians or cars or robots  at the middle level   customers  at the highest level   competing companies ref Yuri G  Karpov   http   www itlab unn ru Uploads AnyLogicNizhniNovgorod2004 pdf  AnyLogic   a New Generation Professional Simulation Tool      VI International Congress on Mathematical Modeling    September 20 26th  2004  NizniNovgorog  Russia  ref    AnyLogic allows the modeler to combine these simulation approaches within the same model   There is no fixed hierarchy   So  as an example  one could create a model of the package shipping industry where carriers are modeled as agents acting reacting independently whereas the inner workings of their transport and infrastructure networks could be modeled with discrete event simulation   Similarly  one can model consumers as agents whose aggregate behavior feed a systems dynamics model capturing flows such as revenues or costs which do not need to be tied to individual agents   This mixed language approach is directly applicable to a wide variety of complex modeling problems that may be modeled via any one approach albeit with compromises     Simulation language     Image AnyLogic Simulation Language jpg thumb   500px  right  Simulation language constructions provided by

systems in terms of entities  transactions  customers  products  parts  vehicles  etc    processes  sequences of operations typically involving queues  delays  resource utilization   and resources   The processes are specified in the form of flowcharts       The Pedestrian Library    is dedicated to simulate pedestrian flows in a  physical  environment   It allows you to create models of pedestrian intensive buildings  like subway stations  security checks etc   or streets  large numbers of pedestrians    Models support statistics collection on pedestrian density in different areas   This ensures acceptable performance of service points with a hypothetical load  estimates lengths of stay in specific areas  and detects potential problems with interior geometry   such as the effect of adding too many obstacles    and other applications   In models created with the Pedestrian Library pedestrians move in continuous space  reacting to different kinds of obstacles  walls  different kinds of areas  as well as other pedestrians   Pedestrians are simulated as interacting agents with complex behavior  but the AnyLogic Pedestrian Library provides a higher level interface for fast creation of pedestrian models in the style of flowcharts       The Rail Library    supports modeling  simulating and visualizing operations of a rail yard of any complexity and scale  The rail yard models can be combined with discrete event or agent based models related to  loading and unloading  resource allocation  maintenance  business processes  and other transportation activities   Beside of these standard libraries user can create his own libraries and distribute them      See also        Comparison of agent based modeling software       List of computer simulation software       List

   Tunable consistency     Writes and reads offer a tunable level of consistency  all the way from  writes never fail  to  block for all replicas to be readable   with the quorum level in the middle       Elasticity     Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added  with no downtime or interruption to applications      Data model    A table in Cassandra is a distributed multidimensional map indexed by a key  The value is an object which is highly structured  The row key in a table is a string with no size restrictions  although typically 16 to 36 bytes long  Every operation under a single row key is atomic per replica no matter how many columns are being read or written into  Columns are grouped together into sets called column families very much similar to what happens in the   BigTable   system  Cassandra exposes two kinds of column families  Simple and Super column families  Super column families can be visualized as a column family within a column family  The top dimension in Cassandra is called Keyspace   Therefore Cassandra can handle maps with 4 or 5 dimensions   Map with 4 dimensions    Keyspace    Column Family   Column Family    Column Family Row   Column Family Row    Columns   Column    Data value  Map with 5 dimensions    Keyspace    Super Column Family   Super Column Family    Super Column Family Row   Super Column Family Row    Super Columns   Super Column    Columns   Column    Data value  The first dimension   Keyspace     Super  Column Family   is limited to a  small  set of schema predefined keys  Cassandra documentation mentions similarities of this dimension with the table definition inside a relational database   Furthermore  applications can specify the sort order of columns within a Super Column or Simple Column family  The system allows columns to be sorted either by time or by name  Time sorting of columns is exploited by applications like   Facebook   Inbox Search where the results are always displayed in time sorted order  Any column within a column family is accessed using the convention column family   column and any column within a column family that is of type super is accessed using the convention column family   super column   column      Prominent users        Facebook   uses Cassandra to power Inbox Search  with over 200 nodes deployed  ref name FBIS        Digg    a large social

controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I O with disk rotation  seeking the head to the appropriate track  and encoding the data into magnetic pulses  Wozniak s controller card had few chips  instead  the   Apple DOS   used software to perform these functions  The   Group Code Recording   used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common   Modified Frequency Modulation MFM    In the end  the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple s Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers  As a side effect  Wozniak s scheme made it easy for   proprietary software   developers to   copy protection copy protect   the media on which their software shipped by changing the low level sector format or stepping the drive s head between the tracks  inevitably  other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection  Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart s Track 0 sensor  When the Operating System wants to go to track 0  the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next lower numbered track  relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0  This process  called  recalibration   made a loud buzzing  rapid mechanical chattering  sound that often frightened Apple novices   The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak s design sensibility  The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs  For example  taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle  the video generation circuitry s memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips  Rather than use a complex analog to digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller  Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller  and used a software loop to measure the timer   The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement  the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory  which was reputedly due to Wozniak s realization that doing it that way would save a chip  it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware  Similarly  in the high resolution graphics mode  color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software  saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors  This also allowed for sub pixel   font   rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels  ref   cite web last Gibson  first Steve title The origins of sub pixel font rendering url http   www grc com ctwho htm accessdate 2006 08 04    ref   Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the   National Television System Committee NTSC   television signal standard  which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement  The original NTSC   television   signal specification was black and white  Color was tacked on later by adding a 3 58 MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B W TV sets  Color is encoded based on the     phase  waves  phase     of this signal in relation to a reference     color burst     signal  The result is that the position  size  and intensity of a series of pulses define color information  These pulses can translate into     pixel  s   on the computer screen   The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle  When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display  it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels  magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels  and white by placing two pixels next to each other  Later  blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel width in relation to the colorburst signal  The high resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more  narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle  The coarse  low resolution graphics display mode worked differently  as it could output a short burst of high frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options   The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry  Rather than having a dedicated sound synthesis chip  the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built in speaker or a line out jack  all other sounds  including two  three and  eventually  four voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis  were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times  Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip  though with six expansion slots  users could add sound functionality via a soundcard like the   Mockingboard     Similar techniques were used for cassette storage  the cassette output worked the same as the speaker  and the input was a simple   Zero crossing threshold detector zero crossing detector   that served as a relatively crude  1 bit  audio digitizer  Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in   frequency shift keying   for the cassette   Wozniak s open design and the Apple II s multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third party devices  including   Apple II peripheral cards   such as   Apple II serial cards Serial controllers    display controllers  memory boards  hard disks  and networking components  There were plug in   expansion card  s   such as the   Z80 card   ref name z80     that permitted the Apple to use the   Zilog Z80 Z80   processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the   CP M   operating system  ref name  z80    including the   dBase dBase II   database and the   WordStar   word processor  There was also a third party   Motorola 6809 6809   card that would allow   OS 9   Level One to be run  The   Mockingboard   sound card greatly improved audio capabilities  allowing simple music synthesis and text to speech functions  Eventually    Apple II accelerators Apple II accelerator cards   were created to double or quadruple the computer s speed      Apple II

the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series  though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak s Integer BASIC    The Apple II Plus was otherwise identical to the original Apple II  The smaller memory sizes were no longer available  so the II Plus always had a total of 48 kB of RAM  expandable to 64 kB by means of the  language card   a 16 kB RAM expansion card that could be installed in the computer s slot 0  The Apple s 6502 microprocessor could support up to 64 kB of memory  and a machine with 48 kB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 kB of read only memory and 4 kB of I O addresses  For this reason  the extra RAM in the language card was bank switched over the machine s built in ROM  allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM  Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3 3 s INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card  The language card was also required to use the   UCSD Pascal   and   FORTRAN FORTRAN 77   compilers  which were released by Apple at about the same time  These ran under the   UCSD Pascal UCSD p System   operating system  which had its own disk format and emitted code for a  virtual machine  rather than the actual 6502 processor  The UCSD P system had

the   Far East   in 1978  with the    Apple II Europlus     Europe  Australia  and the    Apple II J Plus     Japan   In these models  Apple made the necessary hardware  software and   firmware   changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U S  The   power supply   was modified to accept the local voltage  and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed

for   Katakana   writing  full   Kanji   support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine   but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard  thus the German model still lacked the   Umlaut  diacritic  umlauts    for example  For the most part  the Apple II Europlus and J Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus  Production of the Europlus ended in 1983      Apple IIe      Main Apple IIe     Image Apple iie jpg thumb right 250px An Apple IIe with DuoDisk and Monitor        The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the      Apple IIe       a cost reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features  such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 kB of RAM   The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 kB Apple II Plus with a language card  the machine had no slot 0  but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3  the most commonly used slot for 80 column cards in the II Plus   The auxiliary slot could accept a 1 kB memory card to enable the 80 column display  This card contained only RAM  the hardware and firmware for the 80 column display was built into the Apple IIe  remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx style cards  even though the low level details were very different  An  extended 80 column card  with more memory expanded the machine s RAM to 128 kB   As with the language card  the memory in the 80 column card was bank switched over the machine s main RAM  this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software  and in fact the   Apple ProDOS ProDOS   operating system  which was introduced with the Apple IIe  would automatically configure this memory as a   RAM disk   upon booting   Third party aux slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1   megabyte MB    The   nowrap 1 K   80 column card also enabled one new graphics mode  Double Lo Res  80 48 pixels   The extended 80 column card enabled two  Double Lo Res and Double Hi Res  560 192 pixels   Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo Res  40 48  and Hi Res  280 192  Modes  in the case of Double Hi Res  the number of available colors was increased as well  from 6 to 15  Apple IIe s from the very first production run cannot use Double Hi Res  Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built in BASIC  however  so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC  or assembly language programming  or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes   While it was possible for software to switch out the 80 column firmware  making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot  it was not a common thing to do  However  even with the 80 column firmware enabled  slot 3 s I O memory range was still usable  giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus  This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things  such as coprocessor cards and language cards  that did not use slot firmware space   Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk  essentially two Disk II 5 25 inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor  and a new controller card to run it  This controller was  by design  functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector  allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk  The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems  however  and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself   The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the  workhorse  of the line  It also has the distinction of being the longest lived Apple computer of all time   it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly eleven years  In that time  following the original  two important variations were introduced known as the   Apple IIe The Enhanced IIe Enhanced IIe    four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model   Apple IIc    including an upgraded processor called the 65C02  and the   Apple IIe Platinum Platinum IIe    a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era  along with the addition of a built in numeric keypad   An Enhanced IIe with 128 kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988   Two and a half years before the Apple IIe  Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the     Apple III     for business users  This product was not a success  and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100  failure rate   every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault  a famous Apple technical bulletin recommended dropping the machine vertically onto a table to re seat the DIP chips in their loose sockets  Citation needed date April 2010     Still  many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe  without the manufacturing flaws that led to failures in the Apple III

modern   portable computer portables   it lacked a built in display and battery  The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position  It was the first

and 128 kB RAM  with a built in disk controller that could control external drives  composite video  NTSC or PAL   serial interfaces for modem and printer  and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse  Unlike previous Apple II models  the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all  this being the means by which its compact size was attained  Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real time clock into the machine  and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 MB of RAM  The disk port  originally intended for a second 5 25 inch floppy drive  eventually was able to interface to 3  inch disk drives and  via third parties  even hard disks   To play up the portability  two different monochrome   LCD   displays were sold for use with the IIc s video expansion port  although both were short lived due to high cost and poor legibility   An Apple IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film     2010  film  2010       The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12 V DC  allowing third parties to offer battery

after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil   The Ace clones from   Franklin Computer Corporation   are the best known and had the most lasting impact  as Franklin copied Apple s ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so  Franklin s argument  a computer s ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position  and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches  Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market  and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U S   See   Apple Computer  Inc  v  Franklin Computer Corp     Franklin later released non infringing but less compatible clones  these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft like BASIC  but compatibility with other software was hit or miss   Apple also challenged   VTech   s   Laser 128    an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984  in court  This suit proved less fruitful

with software that took advantage of Apple hardware for copy protection     General      Data storage    Originally the Apple II used   audio cassette   tapes for program and data storage  A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the   Commodore Datasette   was never produced  Apple recommended using the   Panasonic Corporation Panasonic   RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation  Apple and many third party developers made software available on tape at first  but after the Disk II became available  tape based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market   The Disk II floppy drive used 5 25 inch   floppy disk  s  The first   disk operating system  s for the Apple II were   Apple DOS DOS 3 1   and DOS 3 2  which stored 113 75 kB on each disk  organized into 35 tracks of thirteen 256 byte sectors each  After about two years  DOS 3 3 was introduced  storing 140 kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track   This upgrade was user installable on older controllers   After the release of DOS 3 3  the user community discontinued use of DOS 3 2 except for running legacy software  Programs that required DOS 3 2 were fairly rare  however  as DOS 3 3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track  a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3 3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3 2 disks to DOS 3 3 disks   On a DOS 3 x disk  tracks 0  1  and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system   It was possible  with a special utility  to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable   A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero   which it did without regard for the read write head s current position  resulting in the characteristic  chattering  sound of a Disk II boot  which was the read write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail   and read and execute code from sector 0  The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system  DOS stored the disk s directory on track 17  smack in the middle of the 35 track disks  in order to reduce the average   seek time   to the frequently used directory track  The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files  Subdirectories were not supported   Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks  since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities  instead  they often wrote their own boot loaders and read only file systems  This also served to discourage  crackers  from snooping around in the game s copy protection code  since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily   Some third party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5 25 inch disks  yielding 160 kB of storage per disk  but the format did not catch on widely  and no known software was published on 40 track media  Most drives  even Disk IIs  could write 36 tracks  simple modifications to DOS for formatting the extra track were common   Incidentally  although the Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single sided   single density  floppy disks  it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a floppy disk to 280 kB   by cutting out a second write protect notch on the side of the disk using a  disk notcher   although a simple hole puncher would do  and inserting the disk flipped over  Early on  diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster  and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day  In practice  however  this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for the same amount of money  and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well   Later  Apple IIs were able to use 3 5 inch disks with a total capacity of 800 kB and hard disks  DOS 3 3 did not support these drives natively  third party software was required  and disks larger than about 400 kB had to be split up into multiple  virtual disk volumes     Apple ProDOS ProDOS    a 1983 descendent of the Apple     s SOS  became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32 MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks required it      Renditions of the  II  name    The  II  portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers  and most printed material followed this lead  The II and II  were labeled  nowiki    and    plus  nowiki   The II small GS  small  and II small c  small  Plus were rendered in   small caps    The   Apple        IIc  and IIe models used slashes         c and   e  There have been some errors in the Apple II s name due to the numerous variations and forms

and it ran first on the Apple II  Many businesses bought Apple II s just to run VisiCalc  Apple s success in the home market inspired competitive   home computer  s such as the   Commodore VIC 20 VIC 20    1980  and   Commodore 64    1982  with estimated sales between 17 and 25 million units   Through their significantly lower price point  these models introduced the computer to several tens of millions more home users   The success of the Apple II in business spurred   IBM   to create the   IBM PC    which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software  at first ported from Apple II versions  later  whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC  The popularity of these PCs and their   IBM PC compatible clones   then transformed business again with   local area network LAN   applications such as   e mail   and later Internet applications such as   Usenet   and the   World Wide Web WWW     One valuable lesson from the Apple II was the importance of an open architecture to the success of a computer platform  The first Apple II s shipped with an   Apple II Reference Manual   containing a complete schematic of the entire computer s circuitry and a complete source listing of the  Monitor  ROM firmware that served as the machine s   BIOS    later this guide had to be purchased separately  and in the case of the Apple II small GS  small   the full technical documentation ran to several volumes   The Apple II s slots  allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory  enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful  at a lower cost  than any competing system  most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary  Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output  one hacker    Don Lancaster    used it to drive a   LaserWriter   printer   Apple decided not to create an open architecture with the initial   Macintosh   models  and this is widely seen as having hobbled its success  It wasn t until the advent of the open architecture   Macintosh II   that the platform took off  However  the   IBM PC   provides an object lesson that success for the

several running subplots that appear frequently throughout the comic  For example  the romance of Jayce Wilder and Alice Fox subplot appears frequently   the two were childhood friends and despite

imagined superhero alter ego of Hawk  who somewhat resembles Stupendous Man from     Calvin   Hobbes      and wears a   Power symbol   bandana down over his eyes  or more recently  a     Naruto     style headband with the Apple  power  logo displayed   and Hawk s troubles during   Ramadan    usually including hallucinations brought on by hunger  and Jayce tormenting him by eating large amounts of food in front of him  There is also a girl named Ashley who starts a vendetta on Hawk with the assistance of her partner Mistah Bear because he destroyed her tricycle      Applegeeks   also makes use of several   running gags    the   Calling shotgun Shotgun Game    in which a person calls out  shotgun   but may be challenged for their position in the front seat by another individual  who does so by dropping their pants  but not undergarments   and in turn must respond by dropping   their   pants and racing the challenger to the vehicle  this has often made the driver pull away at an extremely hurried pace  even if he or she knows the people with the pants down   the plastic bubble that Hawk is placed in whenever he enters an Apple store  in order to avoid   http   www applegeeks

2187|Application Interface Specification|  unreferenced date March 2010   The    Application Interface Specification     AIS  is a collection of open specifications that define   Api application programming interfaces    API  of the most required common functionality for building high availability applications  It is developed and published by the   Service Availability Forum    SA Forum  and made freely available to the public  Besides reducing the complexity and shortening the application development time  the main purpose of the specifications is to ease the portability of applications between different middleware implementations and to admit third party developers to a field that was highly proprietary in the past     History   The AIS is part of the Service Availability Interfaces  SAI  of the SA Forum  The original specifications  released on April 14  2003  were the Availability Management Framework  AMF   the Cluster Membership Service  CLM  and four other utility services  Checkpoint  Event  Message  Lock       Image Classification of AIS Services JPG thumb alt Classification of AIS Services  Figure 1  Classification of AIS services     Additional services were added to this set in subsequent releases  Namely    Release 3  January 18  2006  added the first set of management services  Log  Notification and Information Model Management  IMM     Release 4  February 27  2007  extended the utility services with Timer and Naming    Release 5  October 16  2007  extended the management services with Security and added the Software Management Framework    Release 6  October 21  2008  added the Platform Management Service to close the gap between AIS and HPI  Hardware Platform Interface    Today  AIS consists of 12 services and two frameworks  fig 1   The services are classified into three functional groups   AIS Platform Services  basic AIS Management Services  and general AIS Utility Services   in addition to the AIS Frameworks   Initially  the APIs were defined in   C  programming language  C programming language   only  but as of July 2008  the   Java  programming language  Java   mapping of the different service APIs are being released incrementally     Service Dependencies     Image Typical dependency relations between AIS services JPG  thumb left alt Administrative API for all services through IMM  Figure 2  Typical dependency relations between AIS services     The different services and frameworks of the interface specifications have been designed to be   Modular design modular   and  to a certain degree  independent of one another  This allows a system providing only AIS and no HPI to exist and vice versa   The only required architectural dependency is the dependence on the Cluster Membership Service  CLM   All AIS Services  with the exception of the Platform Management Service  PLM  and the Timer Service  TMR   depend on CLM   It is expected that all AIS Services should use the AIS Management Services for exposing their administrative interfaces  configuration  and runtime management information  fig2      AIS Platform Services     Image Mapping between PML CLM and AMF entities JPG  thumb center upright 2 0 alt PLM  CLM classes  Figure 3 Mapping between PLM  CLM and AMF entities        Platform Management Service  PLM     The PLM provides a logical view of the hardware and the low level software of the system  Low level software in this sense comprises the operating system and virtualization layers that provide execution environments for all kinds of software   The main logical entities implemented by PLM are  fig 3      Image Virtualized architectures in the PLM Information Model JPG  thumb alt PLM  CLM classes  The Figure 4  Virtualized architectures in the PLM Information Model          Hardware Element  HE       A hardware element is a logical entity that represents any kind of hardware entity  which can be  for instance  a chassis  a   Blade server CPU blade    or an I O device  Typically  all   Field Replaceable Unit  s  FRUs  are modeled as hardware elements       Execution Environment  EE       An execution environment is a logical entity that represents an environment capable of running some software programs  For example  a CPU blade or an   Symmetric multiprocessing SMP   machine runs a single operating system instance modeled as an execution environment  Different virtualization architectures are supported  fig 4    PLM   maintains the state   of these entities in the information model and provides means to   control   them and   track   any state changes  To fulfill these tasks for HEs  the PLM Service typically uses HPI  In case of EEs  PLM is in charge of retrieving all necessary information about the health of the operating system and any available virtualization layer      Cluster Membership Service  CLM     The Cluster Membership Service provides applications with membership information about the nodes that have been administratively configured in the cluster configuration  these nodes are also called cluster nodes or configured nodes  and is core to any clustered system  A cluster consists of this set of configured nodes  each with a unique node name   The two logical entities implemented by the Cluster Membership Service are  fig 3         Cluster      Represents the cluster itself and it is the parent object of the cluster node objects       Cluster Node      Represents a configured cluster node   The CLM provides APIs to retrieve the current cluster membership information and to track membership changes  e g  node leave  node join   All cluster wide AIS services must use the CLM track API to determine the membership     AIS Management Services      Information Model Management Service  IMM     The various entities implemented by the AIS services  e g  execution environments  checkpoints  components  etc   are represented as   managed object  s in the SA Forum   information model Information Model    IM   which can be conceived as a   CMDB configuration management database    The managed objects are instances of object classes defined by the relevant AIS service specification  which define the class attributes and administrative operations  The administrative operations specified for the object classes represent operations that can be performed on the entities represented by the objects  e g  locking a service unit or exporting the contents of the IM in XML format  The objects in the IM are stored in a tree hierarchy where an object can have  at most  one parent object and any number of child objects  fig 5      Image APIs provided by the Information Model Management Service JPG  thumb left alt IMM Schematic Overview  Figure 5  APIs provided by the Information Model Management Service     The logical entities represented by the objects in the IM are not generally implemented by the IMM Service itself  instead  user applications and the AIS Services  such as the Checkpoint Service  or the Availability Management Framework provide their implementation  Therefore  these are called    object implementers     OI   For management purposes  all AIS services expose their implemented entities as managed objects through the IMM service   There are two categories of objects and attributes in the IM  runtime and configuration        Run time  computing  Runtime   objects and attributes    reflect the current state of the entities they represent   they are of   descriptive   nature   In contrast     configuration objects and attributes    are   prescriptive   as for management applications   or    object managers     OM    they are the means to provide input to the object implementers on what entities they need to implement   Configuration objects may include both configuration and runtime attributes while runtime objects may include only runtime attributes  Administrative operations may be defined on both object categories   Accordingly  the IMM Service exposes a    Northbound interface southbound    interface   the IMM OI API   to object implementers and a    Northbound interface northbound     interface   the IMM OM API   to management applications  fig 5    e g  SNMP agents  and mediates between these two parties  It is also responsible for storing the persistent objects and attributes     Log Service  LOG     The Log Service is intended for   Event logging Event logging event logging    that is  for collecting cluster wide  function based  as opposed to implementation specific  information about the system  which is suited for system administrators or automated tools   The Log Service enables applications to express and write log records through well known log streams that lead to particular output destinations  such as a named file  Once at the output destination  a log record is subject to output formatting rules  which are configurable and public  The logging application does not need to be aware of any of these aspects  e g  the destination file location  file rotation or formatting  etc   as the Log Service handles them based on the current settings for the targeted log stream  Since the output format is public  third party tools can read these log files   Four types of log streams are specified    alarm    ITU X 733 and ITU X 736 based log records     notification    ITU X 730 and ITU X 731 based log records     system   and   application    The application type is used by applications to define application specific log streams  There is exactly one predefined log stream for each of the alarm  notification  and system log stream types in an SA Forum cluster   User applications are allowed to use any of the predefined streams or create new application specific log streams      Notification Service  NTF     The Notification Service is   to a great degree   based on the   ITU T   Fault Management model  as found in the X 700 series of documents  as well as on many other supportive recommendations   The Notification Service is centered on the concept of a    notification     which explains an incident or change in status  The term  notification  is used instead of  event  to clearly distinguish it from  event  as defined by the AIS Event Service   The NTF service is based on the   Publish subscribe publish subscribe paradigm    The Notification Service defines six notification types  alarm  security alarm  object creation deletion  state change  attribute value change  and miscellaneous  Notifications are generated published by    producers    using the notification producer API  The notification consumers can be either    subscribers     who subscribe for notifications and receive them as they occur  or    readers     who retrieve notifications from persisted logs using the notification consumer API  Both types of notification consumers may define filters which specify characteristics of the notifications they are interested in receiving or reading   Notifications may be generated by AIS Services as well as by applications  AIS Services that generate notifications have a section in the specification that describes their notifications      Security Service  SEC     The Security Service provides mechanisms that can be used by AIS Services to   authenticate   AIS Service  and potentially other  client processes within the cluster and to   authorize   them to perform particular activities  These mechanisms can be used to preserve the   integrity   of the high availability infrastructure and of SA Forum applications  including their data  by protecting against unauthorized access   The enforcement of security is delegated to the AIS Service implementations themselves  Security enabled AIS Services request authorization from the SEC implementation on behalf of their client processes as they initiate different activities  SEC responds to these authorization requests with a granted or denied indication  and it is up to the AIS Service to allow or disallow the operation accordingly  SEC provides these indications based on the set of   Security policy security policies   configured via IMM  It also informs its subscribers about policy changes using appropriate callbacks     AIS Frameworks      Availability Management Framework  AMF     The Availability Management Framework is the key enabler of   Service availability Service Availability   in SA Forum compliant systems  It coordinates the workload of the different entities under its control depending on their state of readiness to provide services  For this purpose  the application needs to be described according to the information model specified for AMF  This model describes which resources belong to the application  within the cluster  and which services the application provides   The basic logical entity of this information model is the    component     which represents a set of resources to the Availability Management Framework that encapsulate some specific application functionality  The workload generated by provisioning some service that can be assigned to a component by AMF is represented as a    component service instance  CSI      When the component is actively providing the service  it is assigned the active state on behalf of the CSI representing the service   The fundamental principle of   fault tolerant design   is to provide the services by a set of   Redundancy  engineering  redundant entities   and therefore components need to be able to act as a standby on behalf of the CSI  The standby components maintain themselves in a state so that they are capable of taking over the service provisioning  should the component with the active assignment fail  The role of AMF is to assign active or standby workloads to the components of an application as a function of component state and system configuration   Accordingly  the APIs provided by the Availability Management Framework enable component registration  life cycle management and workload assignments  They include functions for error reporting and health monitoring  They also allow tracking the assignment of component service instances among the set of components protecting the CSI   The Availability Management Framework configuration includes recovery and repair policies  It allows the prioritization of resources and provides for a variety of redundancy models  These range from the simple 2N model  also known as 1 1  or active standby  to more sophisticated ones such as the N way redundancy model  which allows for more than one standby assignment on behalf of the same component service instance or the N way active that allows multiple active assignments   To simplify the administration  AMF further groups components into service units and service groups  and component service instances into service instances  All of these compose an application  Via IMM  a set of administrative operations are available on these logical entities   For software management purposes  the entities running the same software are grouped into types  which allows for a single point entry for the configuration of these entities      Software Management Framework  SMF     An SA Forum compliant system can be characterized by its deployment configuration  which consists of the software deployed in the system along with all configured software entities  The deployment configuration constitutes an essential part of the information model managed by the IMM Service   The Software Management Framework maintains the part of the information model that describes the software available for  and deployed in  the cluster  But the main purpose of SMF is enabling the evolution of a live system by orchestrating the migration from one deployment configuration to another  In SMF terms  this migration process is called an    upgrade campaign      The Software Management Framework defines an XML schema to be used to specify an upgrade campaign  An SMF implementation migrates the system from one deployment configuration to a new desired one based on such an XML file  which is essentially a   Script  computing  script   of ordered actions and configuration changes that lead to the new configuration   During this migration  SMF   maintains the campaign state model    monitors for potential error situations caused by the migration  and   deploys error recovery procedures as required   To accomplish all these tasks  the SMF implementation interacts at least  1  with AMF in order to maintain availability   2  with IMM to carry out changes to the information model  and  3  with NTF to receive notifications that may indicate error situations caused by the ongoing campaign   The Software Management Framework also provides an API for client processes to register their interest in receiving callbacks when a relevant upgrade campaign is initiated in the cluster and as it progresses through significant milestones  This allows for coordination of application specific actions with the upgrade  This may range from simply blocking the initiation of an upgrade campaign when the application performs some critical task to coordinating application level upgrade action  such as upgrading the database schema or deploying new protocols   For software vendors delivering applications to be deployed in a SA Forum cluster  the Software Management Framework also defines an XML schema for the    entity types file     which describes the software entity types implemented by the application  This information is used to come up with appropriate deployment configurations     AIS Utility Services      Checkpoint Service  CKPT     The Checkpoint Service provides a facility for processes to record   Application checkpointing checkpoint   data incrementally  which can be used to protect an application against failures  When a process recovers from a failure  with a restart or a   failover   procedure   the Checkpoint Service can be used to retrieve the previously checkpointed data and resume execution from the recorded state  thus minimizing the impact of the failure   Checkpoints are cluster wide entities  A copy of the data stored in a checkpoint is called a checkpoint replica  which is typically stored in main memory rather than on disk for performance reasons  A checkpoint may have several checkpoint replicas stored on different nodes in the cluster to protect it against node failures  The process creating the checkpoint may chose from synchronous and asynchronous replica update policies  In case of asynchronous replica  collocation can also be selected to optimize update performance      Event Service  EVT     The Event Service is a publish subscribe multipoint to multipoint communication mechanism that is based on the concept of event channels  one or more publishers communicate asynchronously with one or more anonymous subscribers by using events over an event channel  Event channels are cluster wide named entities that provide best effort delivery of events  Publishers can also be subscribers on the same event channel   Events consist of a standard header and zero or more bytes of published event data  The Event Service API does not impose a specific layout for the published event data   When a process subscribes on an event channel to receive published events  it specifies the filters to apply on the published events  Events are only delivered to the process if they satisfy the provided filters      Lock service  LCK     The Lock Service is a   Distributed lock manager distributed lock service    which is intended for use in a cluster where processes in different nodes might compete with each other for access to a shared resource  For them  the Lock Service provides entities called lock resources  which in turn  application processes use to coordinate access to those shared resources   The Lock Service provides a simple lock model supporting one locking mode for exclusive access and another one for shared access  The locks provided by the Lock Service are non recursive  Thus  claiming one lock does not implicitly claim another lock  rather  each lock must be claimed individually      Message Service  MSG     The Message Service specifies APIs for a cluster wide   Interprocess communication inter process communication  system  The communication is based on message queues identified by a logical name  Any number of processes can send messages to a message queue  but one process at a time at most can open it for receiving  The single message queue thus supports   Point to point  telecommunications  point to point   or multi point to point communication patterns   Processes sending messages to a message queue are unaware of the identity of the receiving process  therefore  the process that was originally receiving these messages may have been replaced by another process during a   failover   or switch over   Message queues can be grouped together to form message queue groups  Message queue groups permit multipoint to multipoint communication  They are identified by logical names so that a sender process is unaware of the number of message queues and of the location of the message queues within the cluster with which it is communicating  The message queue groups can be used to distribute messages among message queues pertaining to the message queue group  MSG defines three   unicast   distribution policies   equal load distribution  local equal load distribution and local best queue   and the broadcast    multicast    policy   On request  the Message Service provides different delivery guarantees  e g  acknowledgement  message persistency  etc   on message queues and on unicast message queue groups      Naming Service  NAM     The Naming Service provides a mechanism by which human friendly names are associated with   bound to   objects  so that these objects can be looked up given their names  The objects typically represent service access points  communication end points and other resources that provide some sort of service   The Naming Service imposes neither a specific layout nor a convention on either the names    UTF 8   encoding assumed  or the objects to which they are bound  It allows the users of the service to select and use their own naming schema without assuming any specific hardware or logical software configuration  The clients of the Naming Service are expected to understand the structure  layout  and semantics of the object bindings they intend to store inside and retrieve from the service      Timer Service  TMR     The Timer Service provides a mechanism by which client processes can set timers and be notified when a timer expires  A timer is a logical object that is dynamically created and represents its expiry time as either an absolute time or duration from the current point in time   The Timer Service provides two types of timers  single event timers and periodic timers  Single event timers will expire once and are deleted after notification  Periodic timers will expire each time a specified duration is reached  and the process is notified about the expirations  Periodic timers have to be explicitly deleted by invoking a timer deletion function      AIS Programming Model    All the AIS services share the same programming model  The same naming conventions  standard predefined types and constants  API semantics  library life cycle control  etc  are used throughout the specification   The SA Forum Application Interface occurs between a   Process  computing  process   and a library that implements the interface  The interface is designed for use by both threaded and non threaded application processes  The term process can be regarded as being equivalent to a process defined by the POSIX standard  however  AIS does not mandate a   Posix POSIX   process  but rather  any equivalent entity that a system provides to manage executing software   The    area server    is an abstraction that represents the server that provides services for a specification    area     Availability Management Framework  Cluster Membership Service  Checkpoint Service  and so on   Each area has a separate logical area server  although the implementer is free to create a separate physical module for each area server or combine one or more area servers into a single physical module     Image Programming usage model of SA Forum AIS services JPG  thumb alt Programming usage model of SA Forum AIS services  Figure 6  Programming usage model of SA Forum AIS services     The area implementation libraries may be implemented in one or several physical libraries  however  a process is required to initialize  register  and obtain an operating system selection object separately for each area s implementation library  Thus  from a programming standpoint  it is useful to view these as separate libraries   The usage model is typical of an event driven architecture  in which the application performs a setup and then receives callbacks as events occur  fig 6    The use of a Service Availability library starts with a call to initialize the library  which potentially loads any dynamic code and binds the asynchronous calls implemented by the process  When the process no longer requires the use of the area functions  it calls the area finalization function  which disassociates the process from the interface area implementation instance and recovers any associated resources   AIS employs both the synchronous and asynchronous programming models  Synchronous APIs are generally used for library and association housekeeping interfaces  Many AIS Services provide the capability of tracking changes in the entities that they implement  The API track typically consists of three functions  the client invoked initiate and stop tracking of an entity  and the service invoked callback to notify the client about  pending  changes of a tracked entity     Backward compatibility   To achieve backward compatibility when evolving the AIS specification  follow a number of rules    A function or type definition never changes for a specific SA Forum release    Changes in a function or type definition  adding a new argument to a function  adding a new field to a data structure  force the definition of a new function or type name  A new function or type name is built from the original name in the previous version with a suffix indicating the version where the function type changed  for instance  saAmfComponentRegister 3       As an exception to the previous rule  new enum values  flag values  or union fields can be added to an existing enum  flag  or union types without changing the type name  as long as the size of the enum  flag  or union type does not change    AIS implementers must ensure that they respect the version numbers provided by the application when it initializes the library and do not expose new enum values to applications using older versions    AIS implementers must also ensure that they respect the version numbers provided by the application when the library is initialized  with regard to new or modified error codes and do not expose error codes that only apply to functions in the most recent version of the specification to applications written to an older version of the specification   As an example  consider a majorVersion Vx of a given service that includes a function f    and assume that f   had to be modified in a newer majorVersion Vy  Vy   Vx   which led to the introduction of the f y   variant that now replaces f   in Vy   Considering an AIS implementation that supports both versions Vx and Vy  a process can initialize the library specifying either Vx or Vy    if the process initializes a library handle with Vx  this handle does not provide access to functions that have been introduced in versions newer than Vx  In particular  this handle will not enable the process to successfully invoke f y     if the process initializes a library handle with Vy  this handle does not provide access to a function introduced in versions older than Vy and then replaced by a newer variant of the same function  In particular  this handle will not enable the process to successfully invoke f     Note  however  that a process may initialize the library multiple times each time with the version appropriate to the functionality it intends to obtain   The specification document of an AIS Service for Vy only includes the latest variant of a function or type definition supported by Vy   Specification releases are versioned as   release code   major version   minor version   The release code is a capital letter  Backward compatibility is maintained only among versions of the same release code  The major version and minor version are incremental numbers  Releases with major number change may introduce new features and change the API in a backward compatible way as described above  Releases with minor number change do not change the API  They provide bug fixes  editorial changes and clarification to their predecessor     Implementation Registry   The SA Forum Implementation Registry is a process that enables implementations of the SA Forum specifications to be registered and made publicly available

non profit organization  http   sidux ev de   sidux e V     was administering and supporting the project   Due to disagreement between sidux e V  and the sidux developers  all development of sidux has been halted in summer 2010 until September 2010  The entire project has been renamed as    aptosid     announced on 2010 09 11  aptosid is a direct upgrade from sidux  The first time a user runs an apt get dist upgrade in sidux  they are asked if they want their repositories changed to the new aptosid site and the system will be seamlessly upgraded to aptosid     Features   aptosid and sidux are based on Debian s most modern branch  sid  They include a manual ref name  sidux manual    Cite web  url   http   manual aptosid com    title   The aptosid Operating System Manual   accessdate   2010

unlike most other Linux distributions  they utilize a true   Rolling release  rolling release cycle     and thus continue to remain current  Users can update all of the system s packages via the command  apt get dist upgrade   Through this model  there should not  in theory  ever be a need to overwrite a aptosid or sidux system by installing an entirely new version  Other Linux distributions that use the rolling release model include   Arch Linux   and   Gentoo Linux Gentoo        Live CD   DVD   USB    Each release comes as a   Live CD   or   Live DVD    booting to a graphical desktop

repositories   Updates are typically run from command line using   apt get     Because post and pre install scripts in the Debian packages may restart your display manager during updates and cause conflicts with running userspace applications  it is recommended that users upgrade their system outside of X  i e  while NOT running the  GUI     This is achieved by applying all updates at  run

Working with parametric objects      ArchiCAD allows the user to work with data enhanced parametric objects  often called  smart objects  by users  This differs from the operational style of other CAD programs created in the 1980s  The product allows the user to create a  virtual building  with virtual structural elements like walls  slabs  roofs  doors  windows and furniture  A large variety of pre designed    ArchiCAD library part customizable objects   come with the program    ArchiCAD allows the user to work with either a 2D or 3D representation on the screen  Two dimensional drawings can be exported at any time  even though the model in the program s database always stores data in three dimensions  Plans  elevations  and sections are generated from the three dimensional virtual building model and are constantly updated if the user  rebuilds  the view   Detail drawings are based on enlarged portions of the model  with 2D detail added in       Collaboration and remote access      ArchiCAD released its first file exchange based Teamwork solution in its version 5 1 in 1997 which allowed more architects to work on the same building model simultaneously  A completely rewritten Teamwork  2 0  solution with a new database approach came out in version 13 in 2009 named Graphisoft BIM Server  Since only the changes and differences are sent to the central storage this solution allows remote access to the same project over the internet thus allowing worldwide project collaboration and coordination        APIs and scripting      Third party vendors and some manufacturers of architectural products have compiled libraries of architectural components for use in ArchiCAD  The program includes Geometric Description Language    Geometric Description Language GDL    used to create new components  Also API  Application Programming Interface  and ODBC database connections are supported   for third party Add On developers  Via direct API links to 4D and 5D software such as Vico Office Suite or Tocoman iLink  ArchiCAD model can be exported to BIM based cost estimation and scheduling  ArchiCAD is also directly linked via API to Solibri s Model checking and quality assurance tools       Data interchange      ArchiCAD can import and export    dwg DWG      DXF   and   Industry Foundation Classes IFC   files among others  Graphisoft is an active member of the International Alliance for Interoperability  IA   an industry organization that publishes standards for file and data interoperability for architectural CAD      Extensions     Various free and commercial add on products and extensions add extra functionality to ArchiCAD or provide further data exchange possibilities with other software applications  Some of these extensions are developed by   Graphisoft    such as the freely available   Google SketchUp      Google Earth   or   Cinema 4D   import export add ons or other extensions sold separately such as   Graphisoft MEP Modeler      Graphisoft EcoDesigner   or Graphisoft   Virtual Building Explorer    while there are a number of add ons provided by third party vendors  such as   Cigraph   or   Cadimage         Version history

various tool vendors and consulting firms   ArchiMate distinguishes itself from other languages such as   Unified Modeling Language    UML  and   Business Process Modeling Notation    BPMN  by its well defined   metamodel    and wider   enterprise modelling   scope  ref Pallab Saha  2008    Advances in Government Enterprise Architecture    p 39   ref      Overview    Just like an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building  ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of   business processes    organizational structures    information flow  s  IT systems  and technical infrastructure  This insight helps the different   Project stakeholder stakeholders   to design  assess  and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains   An   architecture framework   is used to structure the concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language  It divides the   enterprise architecture   in to a business  application and technology layer  In each layer  three aspects are considered  active elements that exhibit   behavior    e g  Process and Function   an internal   structure   and elements that define use or communicate   information     One of the objectives of the ArchiMate language is to define the relationships between concepts in different architecture domains  The concepts of this language therefore hold the middle between the detailed concepts  that are used for modeling individual domains  for example  the   Unified Modeling Language UML   for modeling   software   products  ref Zoran Stojanovi  et al   2007     Service oriented Software System Engineering    p 145 146   ref   and   BPMN   which is

2320|Architectural animation|  Unreferenced date June 2010      Architectural Animation    is a short architectural movie created on a computer  A computer generated building is created along with landscaping and sometimes moving people and vehicles  Unlike an architectural rendering  which is a single image from a single point of view  an architectural animation is a series of hundreds or even thousands of still images  When these images are assembled and played back they produce a movie effect much like a real movie camera except all images are artificially created by computer  It is possible to add a computer created  environment around the building to enhance reality and to better convey its relationship to the surrounding area  this can all be done before the project is built giving designers and stakeholders a realistic view of the completed project  Architectural renderings are often used along with architectural animation     Who uses it   Commercial demand for computer generated rendering is on the rise  but three dimensional scale models are still popular  Typically members of the AIA  American Institute of Architects  and NAHB  National Association of Home Builders  prefer to use 3D animations and single renderings for their customers before starting on a construction project  These professionals often find their clients are unable to grasp the complexity and spacial qualities of large projects without the help of computer generated visual aids  The animations and renderings are usually supplied by small animation studios      Future    Architectural animation is not considered to be the ambition of most small computer rendering firms because of the man hours and computer rendering time that is required to create so many single still images  Not all studios have the software to assemble and incorporate them into a moving sequence  Some smaller companies specialize in high quality single frame computer renderings  Architectural animations require a larger team of artists and animators than single renderings and a much longer time frame is required to complete an animation project  However  many architectural firms are now using architectural animation because it attracts investors and customers who may not know much about building designs   Architectural animation is considered to have a bright future ahead of it as more and more architects and real estate developers are including computer animations in their marketing programs     Architectural visualization    3D rendering   3D walk through   3D demo of city planning   3D demo of landscape planning   Restoration of ancient architecture    Animation    Rendering   Simulation of product and engineering design    Virtual Reality    Digital sand table system for city community planning   GIS  Geographic information system    Multifunctional educational system   Simulation and restoration of cultural heritage and ancient architecture   Virtual shopping mall     See also       Computer animation      3D computer graphics      Architectural rendering       External links      http   www aia org American Institute of Architects  Official website   http   www nahb org National Association of Home Builders  Official website  Examples of  http   www bc media co uk 3d design 3d architectural rendering htm architectural animation    Samples of  http   www dhrendering com Architectural Animation   Modeling   Rendering   Illustration      Category Architectural design     Category Computer aided design  
2322|Architectural metals|   Architectural metals    used in buildings and structures comprise several distinctive metallic materials  Metals serve a wide variety of uses in the built landscape  including structural features  such as nails and trusses  as well as decorative features  such as doorknobs and cladding  Some metals discovered by early civilizations are still in use today  Scientific study has brought a greater understanding of the performance and limits of the various types of metals used in buildings     Metal Types      Lead    The low melting point of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history  Water pipes were frequently constructed of lead  until its health hazards were publicized in the late 19th century   Lead has been a popular roofing material for centuries  being used for roofing  flashing  gutters  downspouts  and conductor heads  Lead was best suited for low pitched roofs  as steep roofs experienced creep  Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations  such as the mid Atlantic states  experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction  called fatigue  Beginning in the 19th century  a roofing material called  terne  or  terneplate  was used  consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead tin alloy  It is frequently confused with tinplate   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 8 11  ref   Lead was also frequently used for window cames  for use in skylights and stained glass  It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation  Finally  lead was frequently added to paint  with red lead used as an anti corrosive pigment for iron  and white lead used as paint for wooden houses  Lead based paint was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating  The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings  due to concerns of lead poisoning      Tin    The principal architectural uses of tin fall into two categories  the alloying of tin with other metals such as copper to form bronze  and the coating of tin on harder metals  such as tinplated iron or steel  Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90  copper and 10  tin  although the content may vary widely  The term  tin ceiling  is a misnomer  as these decorative sheets were never tinned  they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel   Tinplate was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin   Tin roofs   a type of tinplate  was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material  Tinplate was also used for decoration  such as ornamental windows and door lintels  Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing  it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as asphalt shingles or built up roofs  However  since a well maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing  it is more economical when the cost is prorated over the longer lifespan   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 12 13  ref      Zinc    Pure zinc was used for roofing in Belgium  France and Germany  where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing  Starting in the 1820s  Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America  used by builders in New York City and elsewhere  Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures   Zinc coated metals were first patented in 1837  separately by M  Sorel in France and H  W  Crawford in England  The methods employed a  hot dipping  process to coat sheet iron with zinc  By 1839  galvanized  sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City  The Merchant s Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters  Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs  a mode very popular in the Victorian era   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 15 21  ref   Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany as early as 1832  Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc  since it molded readily  was inexpensive compared to stone  and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals   Zinc oxide paints were nontoxic and resistant to pollution  They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s  They had the added benefit of being good inhibitors against rust on iron and steel   During the early decades of the 20th century  the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the United States  It is now back on the upswing and gaining popularity in its pure form  99 95  for building materials  Zinc is still used in alloys such as brass and nickel silver  and in the electroplating of steel as well  Today  galvanized steel and pure zinc material  usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels  are used for roofing a variety of buildings  Creep has been reduced by the introduction of titanium in most architectural zinc available in North America  Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common      Copper and Copper Alloys    The  cupric  metals include copper and its alloys  especially bronze  an alloy of copper and tin  and brass  an alloy of copper and zinc  Copper is a very durable metal  withstanding corrosion when forming a green patina  copper sulfate  Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate  tile  or lead  Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams  or shaped over curved frameworks for cupolas and domes   The initial cost of copper was traditionally high  but its length of service more than compensated for the price  Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers  All nails  screws  bolts  and cleats used with sheet copper had to be made of copper or a copper alloy  otherwise  galvanic  action between the dissimilar metals would occur  causing deterioration   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 22 34  ref   Copper was also used for decorative purposes  including architectural ornaments or sculptures  A very famous example of this is the Statue of Liberty   With aging it turns a deep light green color      Nickel and Nickel Alloys    Although somewhat rare  nickel has been used for plating architectural details  Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys  nickel silver  Monel metal  and stainless steel   Nickel silver was originally called  German Silver   until World War I  It has been called  white brass  but probably should be termed  nickel brass   because it generally contains 75  copper  20  nickel  and 5  zinc  Different percentages result in a range of colors  including silvery white  yellow  slight blue  green or pink  Nickel silver hardware was popular in the United States during the Art Deco and Depression Modern periods  Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes  and it resisted corrosion   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  page 35  ref   Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two thirds nickel and one third copper  It is similar to platinum in color  Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel  The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing of the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909  In 1936  the copper roof on the New York City Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof  Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed  welded  or soldered in place to provide a watertight  continuous cover  Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods  During World War II  however  large quantities of nickel and copper had to be diverted to the war effort and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced  Following the war  stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs   ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 35 40  ref      Iron and Iron Alloys    Iron has become an important architectural building component  It has been used in four common forms  wrought iron  cast iron  sheet iron  and steel  ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980  pages 42 83  ref   Wrought iron was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century  Until the mid 19th century  the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods  straps  nails  and hardware  or to decorative ironwork in balconies  railings fences and gates  Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails  bulb tees  and eventually I beams  It was also used for decorative purposes  such as ornamental balconies or hardware  Since wrought iron is handmade  no two pieces are identical   Cast iron was a major 19th century building material of the Industrial Revolution  Although brittle  it is remarkably strong in compression  It was frequently used for structural purposes  such as columns   building fronts  domes and light courts  Decorative uses have included stairs  elevators  lintels  grilles  verandas  balconies  railings  fences  streetlights  and tombs  The Bradbury Building is one example of extensive decorative cast iron use  Today  cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction  and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices   Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion  forming rust  Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century  although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became  Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a  tin ceiling   although tin was generally not present for indoor uses   Steel was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century  The development of structural steel in the mid 19th century allowed tall buildings to be constructed  Builders and manufacturers turned to steel  which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension  when the Bessemer process was developed in England in 1856  and the open hearth process was invented  steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical  Bridges  railroad companies  and skyscrapers were among the first large scale uses of structural steel  Although iron and steel are not combustible  they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat  Almost all structural steel has to be  fireproofed  in some manner  utilizing a cladding of terra cotta  tile  plaster  poured concrete  sprayed concrete  or sprayed insulation  Ferro concrete  also called reinforced concrete  was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete   Decorative steels used in buildings include    Stainless steel  a chromium nickel steel  developed between 1903 and 1912  Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion  It contains about 18  chromium and 8 12  nickel  Stainless steel is expensive  so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion  One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the Chrysler Building    Copper bearing steels  containing from  15  to  25  copper  develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion  when compared to ordinary steel  by forming a protective oxide coating  having a uniform deep brown color and texture  Eero Saarinen experimented with the material in the Deere and Company building in 1964      Aluminum    Aluminum was not available at a reasonable price or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century  Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s  mainly for decorative detailing  It was used for roofing  flashing  gutters  downspouts  wall panels  and spandrels  Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features  The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the Empire State Building  where the entire tower portion is aluminum  as well as many decorative features  such as the entrances  elevator doors  ornamental trim  and some 6 000 window spandrels  Today  aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members  ref Gayle  Margot and Waite  John G    Metals in America s Historic Buildings  Uses and Preservation Treatments    1980

French Dictionary of Architecture      1856  by   Eug ne Viollet le Duc        Architectural theory    is the act of thinking  discussing  or most importantly writing about   architecture    Architectural theory is taught in most architecture schools and is practiced by the world s leading   architect  s  Some forms that architecture theory takes are the   lecture   or dialogue  the treatise or book  and the paper project or   architectural design competition competition entry    Architectural theory is often didactic  and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools  It has existed in some form since   ancient history antiquity    and as publishing became more common  architectural theory gained an increased richness  Books  magazines  and journals published an unprecedented amount of works by architects and critics in the 20th century  As a result  styles and movements formed and dissolved much more quickly than the relatively enduring modes in earlier history  It is to be expected that the use of the internet will further the discourse on architecture in the twenty 1st century     History      Antiquity    There is little information or evidence about major architectural theory in antiquity  until the 1st century BCE  with the work of   Vitruvius    This does not mean  however  that such works did not exist  Many works never survived antiquity  and the burning of the   Alexandria Library   shows us a very good example of this   Vitruvius was a Roman   writer      architect   and   engineer    active in the 1st century BCE  He was the most prominent architectural theorist in the Roman Empire known today  having written     De architectura      known today as   The Ten Books of Architecture    a treatise written of   Latin   and   Ancient Greek Greek   on architecture  dedicated to the emperor Augustus  It is the only surviving major book on architecture from classical antiquity  Probably written between 27 and 23 BCE  ref Kruft  p 447   ref  it is the only contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived  Divided into ten sections or  books   it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture  from town planning  materials  decorations  temples  water supplies  etc  The famous   orders of architecture   that we can see in every classical architecture are rigorously defined in the books  It also gathers three fundamental laws that   Architecture   must obey  in order to be so considered    firmitas  utilitas  venustas    firmness  commodity  in the sense of functionality   and delight  The rediscovery of Vitruvius  work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance  prompting the rise of the   Renaissance   style  Renaissance architects  such as Niccoli  Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti  found in  De Architectura  their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline      Middle Ages      Expand section date June 2008    Throughout the Middle Ages  architectural knowledge was passed by transcription  word of mouth and technically in master builders  lodges  ref Evers  Thoenes  et al   p 13   ref  Due to the laborious nature of transcription  few examples of architectural theory were penned in this time period  Most works that from this period were theological  and were transcriptions of the bible  so the architectural theories were the notes on structures included therein  The   Abbot Suger   s   Liber de rebus in administratione sua gestis    was an architectural document that emerged with   gothic architecture    Another was   Villard de Honnecourt   s portfolio of drawings from about the 1230s   In   Song Dynasty   China  Li Jie published the     Yingzao Fashi     in 1103  which was an architectural treatise

discoveries  such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum  drove new interest in Classical art and architecture  Thus the term Neoclassicism  exemplified by the writings of Prussian art critic Johann Joachim Winkelmann  arose to designate 18th century architecture which looked to these new Classical precedents for inspiration in building design  ref Robin Middleton and David Watkin  Neoclassicism

Nineteenth century    A vibrant strain of   Neoclassicism    inherited from   Marc Antoine Laugier   s seminal Essai  provided the foundation for two generations of international activity around the core themes of classicism    primitivism   and a  return to Nature     Reaction against the dominance of   neo classical architecture   came to the fore in the 1820s with   Augustus Pugin   providing a moral and theoretical basis for   Gothic Revival architecture    and in the 1840s   John Ruskin   developed this ethos   The American sculptor   Horatio Greenough   published the essay   American Architecture   in August 1843 in which he rejected the imitation of old styles of buildings and outlined the functional relationship between architecture and decoration  These theories anticipated the development of   Functionalism  architecture  Functionalism   in   modern architecture     Towards the end of the century  there occurred a blossoming of theoretical activity  In England  Ruskin s ideals underpinned the emergence of the   Arts and Crafts movement   exemplified by the writings of   William Morris    This in turn formed the basis for   Art Nouveau   in the   UK    exemplified by the work of   Charles Rennie Mackintosh    and influenced the   Vienna Secession    On the Continent  the theories of   Viollet le Duc   and   Gottfried Semper   provided the springboard for enormous vitality of thought dedicated to architectural innovation and the renovation of the notion of style  Semper in particular developed an international following  in   Germany      England      Switzerland      Austria      Bohemia      France      Italy   and the   United States    The generation born during the middle third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper s combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity  In contrast to more recent  and thus  modern   thematically self organized theoretical activities  this generation did not coalesce into a  movement   They did  however  seem to converge on Semper s use of the concept of   Realismus    and they are thus labelled proponents of   architectural realism    Among the most active Architectural Realists were    Georg Heuser      Rudolf Redtenbacher      Constantin Lipsius      Hans Auer      Paul S dille      Lawrence Harvey      Otto Wagner   and   Richard Streiter        Twentieth century    Around the turn of the 20th century   Camillo Sitte   published the   City Planning According to Artistic Principles   which was not exactly a criticism of architectural form  but more precisely an aesthetic criticism of the 19th century s urbanism  Mainly an   urban planning   theory book  it has a deep influence in architecture  as the two disciplines are deeply intertwined  It was also highly successful in its time  Between 1889 and 1922 it is edited five times  French translation came in 1902 and the English translation in 1945  in New York  For Sitte  the most important is not the architectural shape or form of each building  but the inherent creative quality of urban space  the whole as much more than the sum of its parts  Modernist movements rejected these thoughts and   Le Corbusier   energetically dismissed the work  Nevertheless  his work is often used and cited as a criticism to the   Modernist   movement  and reemerged its importance in the   post modernist   movement  late in the sixties  Also on the topic of artistic notions with regard to urbanism was   Louis Sullivan   s   The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered   of 1896  ref Louis H  Sullivan    Kindergarten Chats and Other Writings    Courier Dover Publications  1979  Page 202  ISBN 0486238121  ref  In this essay  Sullivan penned his famous adage  form forever follows function   a phrase that was to be later adopted as a central tenet of Modernist architectural theory  While later architects adopted the abbreviated phrase  form follows function  as a polemic in service of functionalist doctrine   Sullivan wrote of function with regard to biological functions of the natural order  Another influential planning theorist of this time was   Ebenezer Howard    who founded the   garden city movement    This movement formed communities with architecture in the   Arts and Crafts movement Arts and Crafts style   at   Letchworth   and   Welwyn Garden City   and popularised the style as domestic architecture     In   Vienna      modern architecture modernism   had many theorists and proponents  An early use of the term  modern architecture  in print  was in the title of a book by   Otto Wagner    ref Otto Wagner   http   books google com books id AvgjAAAAMAAJ pg PA2 dq   Moderne Architektur  Seinen Sch lern ein

didactic teachings to his students  Soon thereafter    Adolf Loos   wrote     Ornament and Crime      and while his own style can be seen as part of the transition to   Art Deco    his demand for  the elimination of ornament  joined the slogan    form follows function    as a principle of the   modern architecture   movement which came to dominate the 20th Century    Walter Gropius      Ludwig Mies van der Rohe   and   Le Corbusier   provided the theoretical basis for the   International style  architecture  international style   with aims of using industrialised architecture to reshape society    Frank Lloyd Wright    while modernist in rejecting historic revivalism  was idiosyncratic in his theory  which he conveyed in copious writing   Wright did not subscribe to the tenets of the International Style  but evolved what he hoped would be an American  in contrast to a European  progressive course   Wright s style  however  was highly personal  involving his private views of man and nature   He created no major  school  or theoretical movement   Wright was more poetic and firmly maintained the 19th century view of the creative artist as unique genius   This limited the relevance of his theoretical propositions   Towards the end of the century   postmodern architecture   reacted against the austerity of High Modern  International Style  principles  viewed as narrowly normative and doctrinaire      Contemporary    In contemporary architectural discourse theory has become more concerned with its position within culture generally  which is why university courses on architecture theory may often spend just as much time discussing philosophy and cultural studies as buildings  The notion that theory also entailed critique stemmed from post structural   literary studies    This  however  pushed architecture towards the notion of avant gardism for its own sake   in many ways repeating the 19th century  art for art s sake  outlook  Since 2000 this has materialised in architecture through concerns with the rapid rise of urbanism and   globalization    but also a pragmatic understanding that the city can no longer be a homogenous totality  Interests in fragmentation and architecture as transient objects further such thinking  e g  the concern for employing high technology   And yet this can also be tied into general concerns such as   ecology      mass media    and economism   In the past decade  there has been a resurgence of the old  organic design  theories  but in a much more scientific setting  Several currents and design methodologies are being developed simultaneously  and some of these reinforce whereas others contrast with each other  One of these trends is   Biomimicry    which is the explicit copying of forms and structures found in biological organisms for buildings  Architects design organic looking buildings in the belief that by copying nature    Organic architecture   reaches a more attractive form  Another trend is the exploration of computational techniques  which are strongly influenced by algorithms relevant to biological processes  Trying to utilize   Computational creativity   in architecture    Genetic algorithms   developed in computer science are applied to evolve designs on a computer  and some of these are proposed and built as actual structures  There exists  however  a controversy as to whether all such evolved designs through   Design computing   are truly appropriate for buildings  or are merely attractive forms that may be too complex for habitation  The new discipline of   Biophilia   developed by   E  O  Wilson   suggests the advantages of forms inspired by biological structures  but in a more profound way than simple mimicry  Wilson s original idea is extended by Stephen R  Kellert in the   Biophilia hypothesis    and applied to architectural design in the book  Biophilic Design   Mathematical features of biological forms such as   fractals      Scale invariance    very sophisticated notions of   symmetry      Self similarity    and complex   Hierarchy   are proposed as essential tools for designing architectural forms  Trying to understand the complex interaction between humans and their environment gained from   Human computer interaction      Mobile robotics    and   Artificial intelligence   leads to ideas in   Intelligence Based Design    We are witnessing a growth of new ideas that are generating an entirely new type of architectural theory  It bears little resemblance to the dominant school of architectural theory based on

2365|Ariane 5 Flight 501|   Flight 501     which took place on June 4  1996  was the first  and unsuccessful  test flight of the European   Ariane 5     expendable launch system    Due to an error in the software design  inadequate protection from integer overflow   the rocket veered off its flight path 37 seconds after launch and was destroyed by its automated self destruct system when high aerodynamic forces caused the core of the vehicle to disintegrate  It is one of the most infamous   computer bug  s in history   As it was an unmanned flight  there were no victims  but the breakup caused the loss of four   Cluster mission   spacecraft  resulting in a loss of more than US 370 million ref   cite journal   title   The Ariane 5 Software Failure   month   March   year    1997   volume   22   journal   Software Engineering Notes   last   Dowson   first   M    pages    84   doi   10 1145 251880 251992   issue   2    ref       Summary     The Ariane 5 software reused the specifications from the   Ariane 4    but the Ariane 5 s flight path was considerably different and beyond the range for which the reused computer program had been designed  Specifically  the Ariane 5 s greater acceleration caused the back up and primary   inertial guidance   computers to crash  after which the launcher s nozzles were directed by spurious data  Pre flight tests had never been performed on the re alignment code under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions  so the error was not discovered before launch   Because of the different flight path  a data conversion from a   64 bit     floating point   to   16 bit     signedness signed     integer  computer science  integer   value caused a   hardware     exception handling exception    more specifically  an   arithmetic overflow

later the main engine nozzle also  to make a large correction for an attitude deviation that had not occurred   i  A rapid change of   Aircraft attitude attitude   occurred  which caused the launcher to disintegrate at 39 seconds after H0 due to aerodynamic forces        m  Ariane 5 s inertial reference system is essentially the same as a system presently flying on Ariane 4  The part of the software that caused the interruption in the inertial system computers is used before launch to align the inertial reference system and  in Ariane 4  also to enable a rapid realignment of the system in case of a late hold in the countdown  This realignment function  which does not serve any purpose on Ariane 5  was nevertheless retained for commonality reasons and allowed  as in Ariane 4  to operate for approx  40 seconds after lift off   n  During design of the software of the inertial reference system used for Ariane 4 and Ariane 5  a decision was taken that it was not necessary to protect the inertial system computer from being made inoperative by an excessive value of the variable related to the horizontal velocity  a protection provided for several other variables of the alignment software  When taking this design decision  it was not analysed or fully understood which values this particular variable might assume when the alignment software was allowed to operate after lift off   o  In Ariane 4 flights using the same type of inertial reference system there has been no such failure because the trajectory during the first 40 seconds of flight is such that the particular variable related to horizontal velocity cannot reach  with an adequate operational margin  a value beyond the limit present in the software   p  Ariane 5 has a high initial acceleration and a trajectory  which leads to a build up of horizontal velocity five times more rapid than for Ariane 4  The higher horizontal velocity of Ariane 5 generated  within the 40 second timeframe  the excessive value that caused the inertial system computers to cease operation   q  The purpose of the review process  which involves all major partners in the Ariane 5 programme  is to validate design decisions and to obtain flight qualification  In this process  the limitations of the alignment software were not fully analysed and the possible implications of allowing it to continue to function during flight were not realised   r  The specification of the inertial reference system and the tests performed at equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane 5 trajectory data  Consequently the realignment function was not tested under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions  and the design error was not discovered        t  Post flight simulations have been carried out on a computer with software of the inertial reference system and with a simulated environment  including the actual trajectory data from the Ariane 501 flight  These simulations have faithfully reproduced

2386|Arkamys|  Advert article date July 2009      Arkamys    is a   France French   based company specialising in   digital signal processing    Its   audio processing   solutions are applied in the sectors of   Consumer Electronics   and   Car audio     Arkamys was founded in   Paris   in 1998  The company initially used its patented sound   spatialisation   process to   remaster   movies and DVDs for the professional entertainment industry  Today its audio enhancement software is implemented in consumer electronic products  such as   mobile phones   and   mp3 players    as well as   portable media players   and car radios     History      1998   2004     Arkamys was set up to exploit the internationally patented sound spatialisation process invented by one of Arkamys co founders  The Arkamys technology is based on a process which allows the spatialisation of an existing   audio signal      Monophonic sound mono      stereo      5 1    and thereby aims to create a more realistic listening experience  The spatialisation process is initially used to remaster cinematic masterpieces such as   Subway  film  Subway   by   Luc Besson    remastered in 2001  for the cinema and   DVD   industries   Arkamys saw rapid growth and chose to settle down at   Ch teau d H rouville    a recording studio where stars like   Elton John      The Bee Gees   and   Pink Floyd   recorded their music  The Ch teau s main hall was used for the audio tuning and the tapes were afterwards remastered in order to transform a monophonic or stereophonic sound into a   surround sound multichannel sound    Numerous movies were modernised with the help of Arkamys  spatialisation process among theses for instance   Peau d  ne    Donkey Skin   a film inspired by the work of   Jean Cocteau    but also   Bagdad Caf       Dirty Dancing      The Texas Chain Saw Massacre   as well as the series Le Gendarme with   Louis de Funes        2004   Present time     In 2004  Arkamys re orientates its business activities transforming from a service company that remasters movies into a supplier to the Consumer Electronics industry  specialising in car audio  mobile phones and media players  Therefore  the digital processing   algorithms   had to be adapted to the limited processor capacity of mobile devices and auto radios   First customers were media player manufacturer Archos and the airline company   Air France   that chose Arkamys to optimize audio restitution over headphones on their Business Class flights  A major   licensing   deal was closed in 2008 when   Renault   announced to equip most of its   M gane   line up with Arkamys technology  ref   cite web  url http   www 3dsoundbyarkamys com  title Video  Introducing to the 3d Sound by arkamys at Paris motor show

Arkamys     Main technologies      Car Audio software     The audio quality in cars suffers from physical constraints linked to security norms and concerns to optimise in  car roominess    loudspeaker Speakers   are placed low in door panels which results in a perceived sound  coming from the floor  that is in many cases too lateralized  either coming from far left or far right  Audio reproduction is often unnatural and can lead to a phenomenon called   listener fatigue   after an extended period of listening    The aim of Arkamys car audio   software   is to create a natural audio image with a harmonious positioning of music and voice in front of the driver at windshield level  This is called the   sound scene     The main difficulty is to create this sound scene without changing the car s speaker configuration  The software implemented on the radio processes the digital signal of any media players  radio  CD  mp3  etc    The processing has to be optimised for each car model taking into account the specific characteristics of the car s interior  size  form  number and positioning of speakers  The diversity of car models makes several configurations necessary in order to adapt to different equipment levels from low level stereo systems to high end multi channel sound systems which reproduce a   5 1   or   7 1   sound over 10 speakers       Audio enhancement for mobile devices     Due to their small size portable devices like mobile phones and portable media stations are not able to use high performance speakers  Moreover    Audio compression  data  compressing audio formats

nothing to do with externals    diligence      obedience      justice      humility    III  17   Humility divides his view of the world into two parts  one  the understanding of our relation to the

  III  33    This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things  The second part of Geulincx s philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause  Its guiding principle is  Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing  III  222   This leads to a mysticism and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the obligation of

2416|Array controller based encryption|  Orphan date February 2009    Within a   storage network    encryption of data may occur at different hardware levels     Array controller based encryption    describes the encryption of data occurring at the   disk array controller   before being sent to the disk drives   This article will provide an overview of different implementation techniques to array controller based encryption  For cryptographic and encryption theory  see   disk encryption theory        Possible Points of Encryption in SAN      Image Piont of encryption gif thumb right 300px Diagram showing the possible points of encryption within a storage network   The encryption of data can take place in many points in a storage network  The point of encryption may occur on the host computer  in the SAN infrastructure  the array controller or on each of the hard disks as shown on the diagram above  Each point of encryption has different merits and costs  Within the diagram  the key server components are also shown for each configuration of encryption  Designers of SANs and SAN components must take into consideration factors such as performance  deployment complexity  key server interoperability  strength of security  and cost when choosing where to implement encryption  But since the array controller is a natural central point of all data therefore encryption at this level is inherent and also reduces deployment complexity      br style  clear both         Array Controller Based Encryption    With different configurations of a hardware or software array controller  there are different types of solutions for this type of encryption  Each of these solutions can be built into existing infrastructures by replacing or upgrading certain components   Basic components include an encryption   key server    key management client  and commonly an encryption unit which are all implemented into a storage network       Internal Array Controller Encryption       Image Iac gif thumb right 150px Encryption implementation in an internal array controller architecture   For an internal array controller configuration  the array controller is generally a PCI bus card situated inside the host computer  As shown in the diagram  the PCI array controller would contain an encryption unit where   plaintext   data is encrypted into   ciphertext    This separate encryption unit is utilized to prevent and minimize performance reduction and maintain data throughput  Furthermore  the Key Management Client will generally be an additional service within the host computer applications where it will authenticate all keys retrieved from the Key Server  A major disadvantage to this type of implementation would be that encryption components are required to be integrated within each host computer and therefore is redundant on large networks with many host devices    br style  clear both          External Array Controller Encryption          Deleted image removed    Image Eac gif thumb right 150px Encryption implementation in an external array controller architecture       In the case of an external array controller setup  the array controller would be an independent hardware module connected to the network  Within the hardware array controller would be an Encryption unit for data encryption as well as a Key Management Client for authentication  Generally  there are few hardware array controllers to many host devices and storage disks  Therefore it reduces deployment complexity to implement into fewer hardware components  Moreover  the lifecycle of an array controller is generally much longer than host computers and storage disks  therefore the encryption implementation will not need to be reimplemented as often as if encryption was done at another point in the storage network        Encryption at the Front End or Back End Side Array Controller      In an external array controller  the encryption unit can either be placed either on the   Disk array controller Front end and back end side front end side   or the   Disk array controller Front end and back end side back end side   of the array controller  There are different advantages and disadvantages in placing the encryption unit either on the front end side or the back end side      class  wikitable          Advantages   Disadvantages      Front End Side   All data is first encrypted before it moves along the array controller  therefore data is encrypted before sending it through the replication link and or stored in internal array controller cache     Since data is encrypted before it moves along the array controller  data de duplication and data compression cannot be done when sending data through replication link  Therefore huge costs can be incurred when sending huge amounts of data through the replication link       Back End Side   Since all data is encrypted before leaving the array controller  data de duplication and data compression can be done and therefore may save costs since only compressed and unique data is sent through the replication link     Sensitive data may be compromised when sending through the replication link as well as cached data in the array controller compromised      The placement of the encryption unit may highly impact the secureness of your controller based encryption implementation  Therefore this issue must be taken account for when designing your implementation to mitigate all security risks   br style  clear both          Software Array Controller Encryption       Image Sac gif thumb right 150px Encryption implementation in an software array controller architecture   For the software array controller encryption  a software array controller driver directs data into individual host bus adapters  In the diagram on the right  there are multiple host bus adapters with hardware encryption units used for better performance requirements  In contrast  this type of encryption can be implemented with only 1 host bus adapter connected to a network of multiple hard drives and would still function  Performance will definitely be reduced since there will only be one encryption unit processing data  Key management will be done much like the internal array controller encryption mentioned before with the Key Management Client implemented as a service within the Host Computer     br style  clear

them regardless of whether they are seen or ignored by readers  ref name Palant response      quote text Only an ad that generates a sale  either directly because the user clicked it or indirectly via brand awareness and similar  provides value  If you see yourself being paid without providing a value than    sic    you either tricked whoever is paying you       or it is a temporary state where

discusses current or recent news of either general interest  i e  daily newspapers  or on a specific topic  i e  political or trade news magazines  club newsletters  or technology news websites    A news article can include accounts of eye witnesses to the happening event  It can contain photographs  accounts  statistics  graphs  recollections  interviews  polls  debates on the topic  etc  Headlines can be used to focus the reader s attention on a particular  or main  part of the article  The writer can also give facts and detailed information following answers to general questions like   Five Ws who  what  when  where  why and how     Quoted references can also be helpful  References to people can also be made through written accounts of interviews and debates confirming the factuality of the writer s information and the reliability of his source  The writer can use redirection to ensure that the reader keeps reading the article and to draw her attention to other articles  For example  phrases like  Continued on page 3  redirect the reader to a page where the article is continued   While a good conclusion is an important ingredient for newspaper articles  the immediacy of a deadline environment means that   copy editing   often takes the form of deleting everything past an arbitrary point in the story corresponding to the dictates of available space on a page  Therefore  newspaper reporters are trained to write in   inverted pyramid   style  with all the most important information in the first paragraph or two  If less vital details are pushed towards the end of the story  the potentially destructive impact of draconian copy editing will be minimized     Other types of articles      Text articles          Academic paper       mdash  is an    academic

2480|Artificial neuron|An    artificial neuron    is a mathematical function conceived as a crude model  or abstraction of biological   neuron  s  Artificial neurons are the constitutive units in an   artificial neural network     Depending on the specific model used  it can receive different names  such as    semi linear unit         Nv neuron        binary neuron        linear threshold function    or    McCulloch Pitts neuron     The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs  representing the one or more   dendrite  s  and sums them to produce an output    synapse     Usually the sums of each node are weighted  and the sum is passed through a   non linear   function known as an   activation function   or   transfer function    The transfer functions usually have a   sigmoid function sigmoid shape    but they may also take the form of other non linear functions    piecewise   linear functions  or    Step function step functions    They are also often    Monotonic function monotonically increasing      Continuous function continuous      Differentiable function differentiable   and   Bounded function bounded     The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system s   transfer function        Basic structure     For a given artificial neuron  let there be   m     1 inputs with signals   x   sub 0  sub  through   x   sub   m    sub  and weights   w   sub 0  sub  through   w   sub   m    sub   Usually  the   x   sub 0  sub  input is assigned the value  1  which makes it a   bias   input with   w   sub   k  0  sub      b   sub   k    sub   This leaves only   m   actual inputs to the neuron  from   x   sub 1  sub  to   x   sub   m    sub    The output of   k  th neuron is     math y k     varphi  left   sum  j 0  m w  kj  x j  right   math   Where  math  varphi  math   phi  is the transfer function     Image artificial neuron png    The output is analogous to the   axon   of a biological neuron  and its value propagates to input of the next layer  through a synapse  It may also exit the system  possibly as part of an output vector     History    The first artificial neuron was the Threshold Logic Unit  TLU  first proposed by   Warren McCulloch   and   Walter Pitts   in 1943  As a transfer function  it employed a threshold  equivalent to using the   Heaviside step function    Initially  only a simple model was considered  with binary inputs and outputs  some restrictions on the possible weights  and a more flexible threshold value  Since the beginning it was already noticed that any boolean function could be implemented by networks of such devices  what is easily seen from the fact that one can implement the AND and OR functions  and use them in the disjunctive or the   conjunctive normal form     Researchers also soon realized that cyclic networks  with   feedback  s through neurons  could define dynamical systems with memory  but most of the research concentrated  and still does  on strictly feed forward networks because of the smaller difficulty they present   One important and pioneering artificial neural network that used the linear threshold function was the   perceptron    developed by   Frank Rosenblatt    This model already considered more flexible weight values in the neurons  and was used in machines with adaptive capabilities  The representation of the threshold values as a bias term was introduced by   Widrow   in 1960  Fact date March 2008     In the late 1980s  when research on neural networks regained strength  neurons with more continuous shapes started to be considered  The possibility of differentiating the activation function allows the direct use of the   gradient descent   and other optimization algorithms for the adjustment of the weights  Neural networks also started to be used as a general function approximation model     Types of transfer functions    The transfer function of a neuron is chosen to have a number of properties which either enhance or simplify the network containing the neuron   Crucially  for instance  any   multilayer perceptron   using a   linear   transfer function has an equivalent single layer network  a non linear function is therefore necessary to gain the advantages of a multi layer network   Below    u   refers in all cases to the weighted sum of all the inputs to the neuron  i e  for   n   inputs      math  u    sum  i   1  n w  i  x  i    math   where    w    is a vector of   synaptic weights   and    x    is a vector of inputs      Step function     The output   y   of this transfer function is binary  depending on whether the input meets a specified threshold         The  signal  is sent  i e  the output is set to one  if the activation meets the threshold     math y    left    begin matrix  1    mbox if  u  ge  theta    0    mbox if  u    theta  end matrix   right   math   This function is used in   perceptron  s and often shows up in many other models  It performs a division of the   Vector space space   of inputs by a   hyperplane    It is specially useful in the last layer of a network intended to perform binary classification of the inputs  It can be approximated from other sigmoidal functions by assigning large values to the weights      Linear combination     In this case  the output unit is simply the weighted sum of its inputs plus a   bias   term  A number of such linear neurons perform a linear transformation of the input vector  This is usually more useful in the first layers of a network  A number of analysis tools exist based on linear models  such as   harmonic analysis    and they can all be used in neural networks with this linear neuron  The bias term allows us to make   homogeneous coordinates affine transformations   to the data   See    Linear transformation      Harmonic analysis      Linear filter      Wavelet      Principal component analysis      Independent component analysis      Deconvolution        Sigmoid     A fairly simple non linear function  a   Sigmoid function   such as the logistic function also has an easily calculated derivative  which can be important when calculating the weight updates in the network  It thus makes the network more easily manipulable mathematically  and was attractive to early computer scientists who needed to minimize the computational load of their simulations  It is commonly seen in   multilayer perceptron  s using a   backpropagation   algorithm        This part of the article needs to be expanded      See    Sigmoid function      Pseudocode algorithm    The following is a simple   pseudocode   implementation of a single TLU which takes   Boolean data type boolean   inputs  true or false   and returns a single boolean output when activated  An   object oriented object oriented   model is used  No method of training is defined  since several exist  If a purely functional model were used  the class TLU below would be replaced with a function TLU with input parameters threshold

2482|Artificial psychology|  Orphan date February 2009     Unreferenced date July 2008       Artificial Psychology    is a theoretical discipline proposed by Dan Curtis  b  1963   The theory states that when the   artificial intelligence   approaches the level of complexity where the intelligence meets two conditions      Condition I      A Makes all of its decisions autonomously   B Is capable of making decisions based on information that is    New      Abstract      Incomplete   C The artificial intelligence is capable of reprogramming itself based on the new data   D And is capable of resolving its own programming conflicts  even in the presence of incomplete data  This means that the intelligence autonomously makes value based decisions  referring to values that the intelligence has created for itself      Condition II      All four criteria are met in situations that are not part of the original operating program  When both conditions are met  then the possibility exists that the intelligence will reach irrational conclusions based on real or created information  At this point  the criteria is met for intervention which will not necessarily be resolved by simple re coding of processes due to extraordinarily complex nature of the   codebase   itself  but rather a discussion with the intelligence in a format which more closely resembles classical  human    psychology     If the intelligence cannot be reprogrammed by directly inputting new code  but requires the intelligence to reprogram itself through a process of analysis and decision based on information provided by a human  in order for it to overcome behavior which is inconsistent with the machines purpose or ability to function normally  then artificial psychology is by definition  what is required   The level of complexity that is required before these thresholds are met is currently a subject of extensive debate  The theory of artificial psychology does not address the specifics of what those levels may be  but only that the level is sufficiently complex that the intelligence cannot simply be recoded by a software developer  and therefore dysfunctionality must be addressed through the same processes that humans must go through to address their own dysfunctionalities  Along the same lines  artificial psychology does not address the question of whether or not the intelligence is actually conscience or not   The current level of artificial intelligence in 2008 does not approach any threshold where any of the theories or principles of artificial psychology may even be tested  and therefore  for the foreseeable future  artificial psychology will remain a theoretical discipline     Category Artificial intelligence

2516|Asian American studies|  unreferenced date April 2007       Asian American Studies    is an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of Asian ancestry in America  Closely related to other   Ethnic Studies   disciplines such as   African American Studies      Latino a Studies    and   Native American Studies    Asian American Studies critically examines the history  culture  politics  issues  and experiences of   Asian Americans    Drawing from numerous disciplines such as   sociology      history      literature      political science    and   gender studies    Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work  Unlike  Asian  Studies which focuses on the history  culture  religion  etc  of Asian people living in Asia  Asian American Studies is interested in the history  culture  experiences  of Asians living in America     History   Asian American Studies was born in the 1960s as a part of the third world movement on the West Coast that gave birth to African American Studies  Chicano Latino Studies  and Native American Studies  While African American Studies  and to a lesser extent Chicano Latino Studies  have spread quickly to hundreds of colleges and universities around the U S   Asian American Studies  mostly due to smaller numbers of Asian Americans until the repeal of Asian exclusion acts  has not spread as quickly   More recently  however  student protests as well as community pressures  have led to the development of several Asian American Studies programs throughout

2590|Associative Entities|An    associative entity    is an element of the   Entity relationship model    The database   relational model   doesn t offer direct support to many to many relationships  even though such relationships happen frequently in normal usage  The solution to this problem is the creation of another table to hold the necessary information for this relationship  This new table is called an    associative entity        Image Associate Entity png frame An associative entity   An associative entity can be thought of as both an entity and a relationship since it encapsulates properties from both  It is a relationship since it is serving to join two or more entities together  but it is also an entity since it may have its own properties  The associative entity must have identifiers    Unique key Primary Keys    for both adjoining tables  but may also contain its own unique identifier and other information about the relationship   The following guidelines may be used when considering the use of an associative entity     All relationships for the associative entity should be many    The associative entity could have meaning independent of the other entities    The associative entity preferably has a unique identifier  and should also have other attributes    The associative entity may participate in relationships other than the entities of the associated relationship     See also       Many to many  data model        Junction table      References      Modern Database Management   7th Edition   Jeffrey A  Hoffer  Mary B  Prescott  Fred R  McFadden    Category Databases     Category Data modeling     Category Diagrams      lt Asociatyvinis vienetas

forms a part of the subject of   asymptotic analysis       A simple example     File Hyperbola one over x svg right thumb 300px  math f x   tfrac 1  x   math  graphed on   Cartesian coordinates    The   x   and   y   axes are the asymptotes    The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem counter to everyday experience  The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width  So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge together  at least as far as the eye could discern  But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities  the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0  see   Line  geometry  Line     Therefore the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience   Consider the graph of the equation   y   1   x   shown to the right  The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form    x    1   x    where   x   is a number other than 0  For example  the graph contains the points  1  1    2  0 5    5  0 2    10  0 1      As the values of   x   become larger and larger  say 100  1000  10 000    putting them far to the right of the illustration  the corresponding values of   y     01   001   0001     become microscopic relative to the scale shown  But no matter how large   x   becomes  its reciprocal 1   x   is never 0  so the curve never actually touches the   x   axis  Similarly  as the values of   x   become smaller and smaller  say  01   001   0001     making them microscopic relative to the scale shown  the corresponding values of   y    100  1000  10 000    become larger and larger  So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the   y   axis  Thus  both the   x   and   y   axes are asymptotes of the curve  These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a   Limit of a function limit   in mathematics  and this connection is explained more fully below  ref Reference for section   http   books google com books id HTwi2M37rQAC pg PA541  Asymptote     Penny Cyclop dia   The Penny Cyclop

of   calculus   are of curves of the form   nowrap 1   y        fnof      x       These can be computed using   limit  mathematics  limits   and classified into   horizontal      vertical   and   oblique   asymptotes depending on its orientation with respect to the   X   axis  Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as   x   tends to    or  minus    As the name indicate they are parallel to the   X   axis  Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines  perpendicular to the   X   axis  near which the function grows without bound  Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines so that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as   x   tends to    or  minus    More general type of asymptotes can be defined in this case      Vertical asymptotes    The line   x       a   is a   vertical asymptote   of the graph of the function   nowrap 1   y        fnof      x           Some confusion as to notation  commenting out for now if    math  lim  x

       For example  if     x        x      x   1   the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as   x   approaches 1  So    math  lim  x to 1  frac x  x 1   infty  math  and the curve has a vertical asymptote of   x   1       The function         x    may or may not be defined at   a    and its precise value at the point   x       a   does not affect the asymptote   For example  for the function    math f x     begin cases   frac 1  x     mbox if   x   0     5    mbox if    x  le 0   end cases   math   has a limit of    as   nowrap   x    rarr  0 sup    sup             x

function to intersect a vertical asymptote  or a vertical line in general  in more than one point      Horizontal asymptotes      File Asymptote03 png right frame The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes  An example of such a function would be  math y  arctan x    math       Horizontal asymptotes   are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as   nowrap   x    rarr    infin      The horizontal line   y       c   is a horizontal asymptote of the function   y             x    if   math  lim  x rightarrow   infty f x  c  math  or  math  lim  x  to   infty  f x    c   math  In the first case          x    has   y       c   as asymptote when   x   tends to  minus    and in the second that         x    has   y       c   as an asymptote as   x   tends to     For example the arctangent function satisfies     math  lim  x rightarrow   infty  arctan x    pi 2  math  and  math  lim  x rightarrow  infty  arctan x   pi 2   math   So the line   nowrap 1   y      minus  pi  2   is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when   x   tends to  minus    and   nowrap 1   y      pi  2   is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when   x   tends to      Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides  or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions  For example  the function   nowrap 1     x      1    x   sup 2  sup  1    has a horizontal asymptote at   y     0 when   x   tends both to  minus   and    because  respectively     math  lim  x to   infty  frac 1  x 2 1   lim  x to   infty  frac 1  x 2 1  0   math      Oblique asymptotes      File 1 over x plus x svg right thumb 220px In the graph of  math f x  x  tfrac 1  x   math   the   y   axis    x     0  and the line   y      x   are both asymptotes    When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the   x    or   y   axis  it is called an   oblique asymptote   or   slant asymptote    A function   f     x    is asymptotic to the straight line   nowrap 1   y       mx       n        m     0  if   math  lim  x  to   infty  left  f x   mx n  right    0     mbox  or    lim  x  to   infty  left  f x   mx n  right    0   math   In the first case the line   nowrap 1   y       mx       n     is an oblique asymptote of         x    when   x   tends to     and in the second case the line   nowrap 1   y       mx       n     is an oblique asymptote of     x    when   x   tends to  minus    An example is     x        x   minus 1   x    which has the oblique asymptote   y       x      m     1    n     0  as seen in the limits   math  lim  x to pm infty  left f x  x

Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes    Asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits  although the derivations of such methods typically use limits       General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions     The oblique asymptote  for the function   f     x     will be given by the equation   y     mx     n    The value for   m   is computed first and is given by    math m stackrel  text def      lim  x rightarrow a f x  x  math   where   a   is either  math   infty  math  or  math   infty  math  depending on the case being studied  It is good practice to treat the two cases separately  If this limit doesn t exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction   Having   m   then the value for   n   can be computed by    math n stackrel  text def      lim  x rightarrow a  f x  mx   math   where   a   should be the same value used before  If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction  even should limit defining   m   exist  Otherwise   nowrap 1   y       mx       n     is the oblique asymptote of         x    as   x   tends to   a     For example  the function   nowrap 1    fnof      x       2  x   sup 2  sup    3  x     1    x     has    math m  lim  x rightarrow  infty f x  x  lim  x rightarrow  infty  frac 2x 2 3x 1  x 2  2  math  and then   math n  lim  x rightarrow  infty  f x  mx   lim  x rightarrow  infty  left  frac 2x 2 3x 1  x  2x right  3  math   so that   nowrap 1   y     2  x     3   is the asymptote of         x    when   x   tends to     The function   nowrap 1    fnof      x      ln   x     has    math m  lim  x rightarrow  infty f x  x  lim  x rightarrow  infty  frac  ln x  x  0  math  and then    math n  lim  x rightarrow  infty  f x  mx   lim  x rightarrow  infty  ln x  math   which does not exist   So   nowrap 1   y     ln   x     does not have an asymptote when   x   tends to          Asymptotes for rational functions     A   rational function   has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique  slant  asymptote  and possibly many vertical asymptotes   The   Degree of a polynomial degree   of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine

When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator  the function has an oblique  slant  asymptote  The asymptote is the polynomial term after   Polynomial long division dividing   the numerator and denominator  This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction  there will be a linear term  and a remainder  For example  consider the function    math f x   frac x 2 x 1  x 1  x  frac 1  x 1   math  shown to the right  As the value of   x   increases    f   approaches the asymptote   y       x    This is because the other term    y     1    x   1  becomes smaller   If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator  and the denominator does not divide the numerator  there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as   x   increases  but the quotient will not be linear  and the function does not have an oblique asymptote       Transformations of known functions     If a known function has an asymptote  such as   y   0 for   f   x    e   sup   x    sup    then the translations of it also have an asymptote    If   x     a   is a vertical asymptote of   f     x     then   x     a     h   is a vertical asymptote of   f     x     h      If   y     c   is a horizontal asymptote of   f     x     then   y     c     k   is a horizontal asymptote of   f     x      k    If a known function has an asymptote  then the   Homothetic transformation scaling   of the function also have an asymptote     If   y     ax     b   is an asymptote of   f     x     then   y     cax     cb   is an asymptote

example  the upper right branch of the curve   y     1   x   can be defined parametrically as   x       t      y     1   t    where   t   0   First    x       as   t       and the distance from the curve to the   x   axis is 1   t   which approaches 0 as   t        Therefore the   x   axis is an asymptote of the curve  Also    y       as   t     0 from the right  and the distance between the curve and the   y   axis is   t   which approaches 0 as   t     0  So the   y   axis is also an asymptote  A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes   Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve  the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization  In fact  if the equation of the line is  math ax by c 0  math  then the distance from the point   A     t         x     t      y     t     to the line is given by   math  frac  ax t  by t  c    sqrt a 2 b 2    math  if     t    is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes   math  frac  ax  gamma t   by  gamma t   c    sqrt a 2 b 2    math  which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression   An important case is when the curve is the   Graph of a function graph   of a   real function    a function of one real variable and returning real values   The graph of the function   y             x    is the set of points of the plane with coordinates    x           x      For this  a parameterization is   math t mapsto  t f t     math  This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals    a     b     where   a   can be  minus   and   b   can be      An asymptote can be either vertical or non vertical  oblique or horizontal   In the first case its equation is   x       c    for some real number   c    The non vertical case has equation   nowrap 1   y       mx       n      where   m   and  math n  math  are real numbers  All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples   Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions  a general curve may have more than two non vertical asymptotes  and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once

2628|Asymptotic expansion|In   mathematics   an    asymptotic expansion        asymptotic series    or    Poincar  expansion     after   Henri Poincar     is a formal series of functions which has the property that truncating the series after a finite number of terms provides an approximation to a given function as the argument of the function tends towards a particular  often infinite  point   If  phi  sub   n    sub  is a sequence of continuous functions on some domain  and if   L   is a  possibly infinite  limit point of the domain  then the sequence constitutes an    asymptotic scale    if for every   n     math  varphi  n 1  x    o  varphi n x       x  rightarrow L   math   If   f   is a continuous function on the domain of the asymptotic scale  then   f   has an asymptotic expansion of order   N   with respect to the scale as a formal series  math  sum  n 0   infty a n  varphi  n  x   math  if   math f x     sum  n 0   N 1  a n  varphi  n  x    O  varphi  N  x       x  rightarrow L   math  or   math f x     sum  n 0   N 1  a n  varphi  n  x    o  varphi  N 1  x       x  rightarrow L    math  If one or the other holds for all   N    then we write   math  f x   sim  sum  n 0   infty a n  varphi n x       x  rightarrow L    math  See   asymptotic analysis   and   big O notation   for the notation   The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers  Methods of generating such expansions include the   Euler Maclaurin summation formula   and integral transforms such as the   Laplace transform Laplace   and   Mellin transform Mellin   transforms  Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion    Since a   convergent     Taylor series   fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well  the phrase  asymptotic series  usually implies a   non convergent   series  Despite non convergence  the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms   Typically  the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term  This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as superasymptotics  ref   cite journal first John P  last  Boyd title  The Devil s Invention  Asymptotic  Superasymptotic and Hyperasymptotic Series  journal Acta Applicandae Mathematicae volume 56 issue 1 pages 1 98 year 1999 doi 10 1023 A 1006145903624    ref  The error is then typically of the form  math  sim exp left   frac c   epsilon  right   math  where  math  epsilon  math  is the expansion parameter  The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter  It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error  e g  by employing resummation methods such as   Borel resummation   to the divergent tail  Such methods are often referred to as hyperasymptotic approximations      Examples of asymptotic expansions        Gamma function       math  frac e x  x x  sqrt 2 pi x    Gamma x 1   sim 1  frac 1  12x   frac 1  288x 2   frac 139

Bernoulli numbers   and  math s   overline 2m 1    math  is a   rising factorial    This expansion is valid for all complex   s   and is often used to compute the zeta function by using a large enough value of   N    for instance  math N    s   math        Error function       math   sqrt  pi x e  x 2   rm erfc  x   sim 1  sum  n 1   infty   1  n  frac  2n    n  2x   2n     math     Detailed example   Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence  Thus  for example  one may start with the ordinary series     math  frac 1  1 w   sum  n 0   infty w n   math   The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane  math w ne 1  math   while the right hand side converges only for  math  w   1  math   Multiplying by  math e   w t   math  and integrating both sides yields     math  int 0  infty  frac e   w t   1 w    dw     sum  n 0   infty t  n 1   int 0  infty e   u  u n   du   math   after the substitution  math u w t  math  on the right hand side  The integral on the left hand side  understood as a   Cauchy principal value    can be expressed in terms of the   exponential integral     The integral on the right hand side may be recognized as the   gamma function    Evaluating both  one obtains the asymptotic expansion    math e   1 t     operatorname Ei  left  frac 1  t  right     sum   n 0   infty n     t  n 1     math   Here  the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non zero value of   t    However  by truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms  one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of  math  operatorname Ei  1 t   math  for sufficiently small   t    Substituting  math x  1 t  math  and noting that  math  operatorname Ei  x   E 1  x   math  results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article     References    references     Bleistein  N  and Handlesman  R

strategy board game that involves play by two parties on a seven by seven square grid  The object of the game is to make your pieces constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game  by converting as many of your opponent s pieces as possible   Each player begins with two pieces  white and black  for the first player and second player respectively  The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board  with white in the top left and bottom right and black on the other two  White moves first   During their turn  players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction    Diagonal   distances are equivalent to   orthogonal   distances  e g  it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally  If the destination is adjacent to the source  a new piece is created on the empty departure square  Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination  After the move  all of the opponent player s pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player  Players must move unless no legal move is possible  in which case they must pass   The board configuration may be altered by having certain squares filled  not playable by either player   or using different board sizes   The game ends when all squares have been filled or one of the players has no remaining pieces  The player with the most pieces wins  A draw may occur when the number of squares are even  either from non playable squares or non standard sizes having an even number of squares  Some versions also implement the   threefold repetition   rule from chess      Other versions      Image Hexxagon screenshot gif thumb A screenshot of   Hexxag n     The arcade version is timed  similarly to   blitz chess    Each player s timer counts down while it is their turn to move  they lose if it reaches zero  but may buy more time  100 seconds per quarter  while the game is in progress  After completing a game  whether they won or lost   a player may choose whether or not to play another game with the time remaining   Ataxx can be found all over the internet in

as they weigh   lighter than air less than air        In astrobiological speculation     Carl Sagan   proposed  albeit offhandedly  that this kind of creature could live in the atmosphere of a   gas giant    such as   Jupiter    ref name  cosmos  Sagan  Carl  Cosmos  Episode 2  1980  ref  Illustrations of atmospheric beasts have appeared in books  exhibiting speculation as to the exotic forms

cryptozoology   and   UFO   related contexts  Through   ufology   history  many authors wondered if the purported spaceships they were allegedly investigating could be some kind of animals living in   Earth s atmosphere     Early UFO writer   Trevor James Constable   believed that the UFO phenomenon was best explained by the presence of large   amoeba   like animals inhabiting Earth s atmosphere  He called these hypothetical creatures  critters   Constable speculated that they spent most of their time in an invisible low density state and propelled themselves through the air with    orgonic energy    a force common to all living creatures   When they increased their density  the animals became visible  He thought that  critters  were carnivores and the   Cattle mutilation mutilated animal carcasses   and   unexplained disappearances   were evidence that they sometimes preyed on humans and livestock  The implementation of   radar   was theorized to be the reason that the critters were being seen more often  as Constable imagined that it disturbs them out of hiding  ref name  reece    cite book    last  Reece    first  Gregory L      title  UFO Religion  Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture     publisher  I  B  Tauris     date  August 21  2007    pages   17      ref     In fiction   Atmospheric creatures on   Earth   have served as the premise of several   science fiction   stories since the early 20th century  though all of these refer to atmospheric beasts on Earth  not the Sagan hypothesis of creatures living in the atmospheres of gas giants   The first occurrence of such creatures in science fiction was in   Will A  Page   s 1911 short story  The Air Serpent   which  as the title implies  was about a flying  reptilian looking creature    Arthur Conan Doyle   elaborated upon the idea in his 1913 story    The Horror of the Heights     which portrayed an entire ecosystem of semi solid beasts living at previously undiscovered heights in the atmosphere  as did   Ray Bradbury   in     The Martian Chronicles         Spider Robinson   s novel     Telempath     features such animals called  Muskys   which attacked the Earth when large amounts of   pollution   began to affect the air     Kenneth Oppel   s     Airborn     series take place in an   alternate history   in which a number of atmospheric beasts exist     James Blish   s     Cities in Flight     makes mention of a bioluminescent  jellyfish like beast which exists as the only life form on the planet Jupiter  making its home strictly within the atmosphere   The game   Star Control II   includes a race of balloon like aliens called the  Slylandro   who are native to a distant gas giant  living only within a certain air density  While intelligent and long lived  they have little technology and no means of travelling beyond their planet  as all material beyond a certain density sinks to levels of their atmosphere they cannot survive in   In the game   City of Heroes    Kheldians are energy beings that can bond with living creatures in a symbiotic relationship  and after generations are able to  memorize  their  host pattern  to transform to one of these species at will  One of the species they can transform into is a tentacled  squid like creature that is said to have lived in the atmosphere of a gas giant     See also      Bioship      Extremophiles

2715|Attribute clash|  Image MSX Computer Color Limit gif right thumb 209px The effect of attribute clash on MSX 1 systems when using the 256 192 Highres mode of MSX 1      Attribute clash     also known as    colour clash    or    bleeding     was a display artifact caused by limits in the graphics circuitry of a number of early colour 8 bit   home computer  s  most notably the   Sinclair Research     ZX Spectrum    where it meant that only two colours could be used in any area of 8 8 pixels  Programmer workarounds to prevent this limit from becoming apparent have since been considered an element of Spectrum user culture      Causes   Attribute clash on the ZX Spectrum was caused by its idiosyncratic display memory layout  designed in such a way as to minimise memory use of the   frame buffer    and optimise for text display instead of graphics  Rather than limit the colour palette to conserve memory  Sinclair s design stored   pixel     bitmap   and colour information in separate areas of memory  While the bitmap specified the state of individual pixels  either on or off   the colour information  or  attributes   corresponded to the text character matrix  mdash  24 rows of 32 columns  mdash  with one   byte   per 8x8 pixel character cell  This byte encoded two 3 bit values  known as   INK    foreground colour  and   PAPER    background colour  after the   BASIC   instructions used to define the colour values  Two other binary values were included in an attribute  a   BRIGHT   bit indicating one of two brightness levels for the two colours  and a   FLASH   bit  which  when set  caused the two colours to be swapped at regular intervals  This scheme provided 15 different colours  the eight combinations of red  green and blue at two brightness levels  except for black  which appeared the same at both brightness   Thus  each 8x8 pixel block could only contain 2 colours from the 15 available  which must both be from either the BRIGHT or non BRIGHT halves of the palette  Trying to add a third colour in an 8x8 pixel area would result in the three colors being reduced to two by the ZX Spectrum    The ZX Spectrum used 6144 bytes for pixel information  with one byte representing a row of eight pixels  and 768 bytes used for the colour attributes  thus giving a total of 6912 bytes for the entire graphics display  a relatively small total for a computer of the Spectrum s era with  colour  capabilities  This graphics architecture was retained right through to Sinclair and   Amstrad   s later redesigns of the Spectrum  up until Amstrad s final model  the ZX Spectrum  3  despite subsequent models having contained 128 kB of RAM  reducing the need to save memory in this manner  The architecture was retained to prevent loss of   backwards compatibility     Attributes were used by a variety of other computers and consoles  including the   Commodore 64    the   MSX   and   Nintendo Entertainment System NES    although the size of the attribute blocks and the number of colours per block varied  However  with the use of hardware   sprite  computer graphics  sprites   and   scrolling    attribute clash could be avoided   The   Thomson MO5   and   Thomson TO7 TO7   microcomputers  the   Tangerine Computer Systems Oric 1 Oric 1    the   MSX MSX 1 MSX 1     computer architecture architecture    and other systems based on the   Texas Instruments TMS9918     Video Display Controller   display a very similar constraint  for each group of eight pixels horizontally  only two colours out of 16 are available  giving a similar but less severe effect than with the Spectrum   The MSX 1 did not have just one single color attribute byte available for a whole 8x8 pixel area  as was the case with the Sinclair Spectrum  but eight  one attribute byte for each 8 1 pixel area   Thus  while the Spectrum was limited to one color pair for a square area of 8x8 pixels  the MSX 1 was only limited to one color pair for a  line  of eight adjacent pixels  In addition MSX1 could use   Sprite  computer graphics  sprites   which were not bound to any attribute clash problems  although MSX 1 sprites did have their own limitations     In practice this technical advantage often did not help MSX 1 systems to produce better pictures  The problem for the MSX 1 was that many European software companies who converted Spectrum games to MSX 1 ignored all the improvements the MSX 1 had over the Spectrum  and thus the resulting MSX 1 versions had the same amount of attribute clash as the original Spectrum games  To ease conversion  the software developers simply copied the single attribute byte value of the Spectrum to all eight corresponding attribute bytes of the MSX 1  For the same reason  the software companies also ignored the sprite capabilities of the MSX 1  and because the video display capabilities were otherwise quite similar  256 192 resolution  16 colors   both systems produced virtually identical displays for the same game  In contrast  Japanese MSX 1 games did use all the capabilities of MSX 1  often resulting in better looking games     Effects   To avoid attribute clash  static graphic displays had to be constructed with care  Finely detailed colour graphics were impossible  as colour could only be applied in 8 8 pixel blocks  Careful design could achieve impressive results  as could synchronizing colour changes to the refresh rate of the display  mdash  usually a television set   However  animated displays were more difficult  mdash  a distinct drawback in a machine whose primary use was playing   video game  s  If just one pixel in an 8 8 block was recoloured because a moving part of the display touched it  the entire block would change colour  Thus detailed moving graphics caused large ugly fringes of rapidly changing colours to follow them around     Workarounds   Early software simply ignored the problem  Later  the standard workaround was to use colour for static display elements  mdash  such as a decorative border around the edges of the screen  which might include score displays and so on  or some form of instrumentation  mdash  with a smaller central   monochrome   area containing all the animated graphics  This also made graphics faster  as less of the screen had to be updated  mdash  both a smaller region  plus only changing pixel information and leaving the colour area untouched   Some late Spectrum software  such as FTL s     Lightforce  video game  Lightforce      used extremely careful graphics design to achieve full colour moving graphics  essentially by limiting both the design of the onscreen elements and their paths of motion to 8 8 colour resolution boundaries  The moving elements were thus relatively large and rather blocky or squarish  and their movement was constrained  but this was not visually obvious and the sight of moving full colour graphics was hugely impressive to Spectrum owners   No mainstream developers were able to find a suitable all round fix for the attribute clash problem  instead preferring to use the monochrome graphics method when fast  clear graphics were needed  and full colour graphics when the situation permitted   It was possible by paying careful attention to timing to modify the attribute area of RAM at certain specific times as the display was drawn   let the display hardware draw one line of the display  then change the attribute RAM before the next line is drawn to give the effect of different attributes for each individual line  These changes had to be done in software and were time consuming to program  meaning that this technique was usually limited to special effects  This technique was also very popular in the demoscene     Screenshots showing the problem and solutions      class  wikitable     bgcolor   CCCCCC       Most illustrative of the problem were games pre 1987 that ignored attribute clash  such as shown here by the game     Knight Tyme      Note how the central character  the small figure with a knight s helmet just to the right of the green plant  is almost hidden by the attribute clash that has occurred    Knight Tyme   was one of the few games that let players select between two modes of attribute clash  one which ignored main character attributes  producing the shown effect   and one which applied main character attributes  turning any graphics surrounding the character white       Image Knight tyme attribute clash png center 256px        One workaround was to simply render the graphics in two colours  otherwise known as monochrome  as shown here with the Spectrum version of     Knight Lore     in 1984       Image Knight lore 3 gif center 256px        Many games used full colour backgrounds and  character scrolling   where the environment was scrolled eight pixels at a time   but monochrome sprites that were effectively transparent  as displayed here in     Double Dragon  arcade game  Double Dragon      The sprites in this case were drawn in such a way so they stand out  avoiding dependence on colour  Many games used this method with smooth pixel by pixel scrolling  but the attribute clash as elements of one character block were  passed  to the next were clearly visible       Image Spectrum Double Dragon png 320px        A prominent  and less successful  example of the use of full colour graphics was the Spectrum conversion of     Altered Beast      Note that the game suffers from considerable attribute clash       Image Spectrum Altered Beast png 320px        Programmer   Don Priestley   developed a distinctive style for several of his games by using large  cartoon like sprites which were carefully designed to span whole character blocks without appearing unduly square  A disadvantage of this technique was that the gameplay had to be designed around the graphics  and so it was not useful for   porting ports   from other platforms  Games that used this technique included   Popeye        The Trap Door  game  The Trap Door      shown right     Through the Trapdoor    and     Flunky  computer game  Flunky      Other developers who used a similar technique included   Mike Singleton    with     Dark Sceptre      and Gang of Five  with     Dan Dare  Pilot of the Future           Image ZX trapdoor1 png 320px             References      http   www worldofspectrum org faq reference reference htm comp sys sinclair FAQ  Reference

universal    also      ii     The outcome of the auction does not depend on the identity of the bidders  i e   auctions are   anonymous     Most auctions have the feature that participants submit   bids    amounts of money they are willing to pay      Standard    auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid   A    nonstandard    auction does not require this  e g  a lottery      Types of auction   There are traditionally four types of auction that are used for the allocation of a single item       First price sealed bid auctions   in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer  The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins  paying a price equal to the exact amount that he or she bid      sealed second price auction Second price sealed bid auctions  Vickrey auctions    in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer  The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins  paying a price equal to the exact amount of the   second highest    bid      English auction Open Ascending bid auctions  English auctions    in which the price is steadily raised by the auctioneer with bidders dropping out once the price becomes too high  This continues until there remains only one bidder who wins the auction at the current price      Dutch auction Open Descending bid auctions  Dutch auctions    in which the price starts at a level sufficiently high to deter all bidders and is progressively lowered until a bidder indicates that he is prepared to buy at the current price  He or she wins the auction and pays the price at which they bid   Most auction theory revolves around these four  standard  auction types   However  other auction types have also received some academic study  such as       All pay auction  s in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer  The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins  paying a price equal to the exact amount that he or she bid  All losing bidders are also required to make a payment to the auctioneer equal to their own bid in an all pay auction  This auction format is non standard  but can be used to understand things such as election campaigns  in which bids can be interpreted as campaign spending  or queuing for a scarce commodity  in which your bid is the amount of time for which you are prepared to queue       Amsterdam auction Amsterdam auctions  Amsterdam auctions    in which the auction consists of two phases  An open ascending phase  followed by an open descending phase  The descending phase starts with a multitude of the winning price of the ascending phase to deter all bidders  The winner of the ascending phase always gets a percentage revenue of the winning price in that phase  If the winner in the descending phase is the same person  he or she will get a reduction of the highest bid by the percentage of the winning price in the ascending phase      Unique bid auction  s   Many   homogenous item auction  s  e g

A game theoretic auction model is a   Game theory Representation of games mathematical game   represented by a   Set  mathematics  set   of players  a set of actions    Strategy strategies    available to each player  and a payoff   vector  geometric  vector   corresponding to each   combination   of strategies   Generally  the players are the buyer s  and the seller s    The action set of each player is a set of bid   Function  mathematics  functions   or   reservation price  s   Each bid function maps the player s   Value  economics  value    in the case of a buyer  or   cost    in the case of a seller  to a bid   price     The payoff of each player under a combination of strategies is the   Expected utility hypothesis expected utility    or   Expected value expected   profit  of that player under that combination of strategies   Game theoretic models of auctions and strategic bidding generally fall into either of the following two categories   In a   private values auction model private value model    each participant  bidder  assumes that each of the   Competition competing   bidders obtains a   random     private value   from a   probability distribution     In a   Common value auction common value   model  each participant assumes that any other participant obtains a random signal from a probability distribution common to all bidders   Usually  but not always  a private values model assumes that the values are   Statistical independence independent   across bidders  whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common   parameter  s of the probability distribution     Image EnumaElish102 jpg thumb 100px right Ex post equilibrium in a simple auction market   When it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders  value   Probability distribution distributions    most of the published research assumes   Symmetric game symmetric   bidders   This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values  or signals  is identical across bidders   In a private values model which assumes independence  symmetry implies that the bidders  values are   I i d  independently and identically distributed  i i d      An important example  which does not assume independence  is   Paul Milgrom Milgrom   and   Robert J  Weber Weber   s  general symmetric model   1982   ref

2738|Audio Engineering Society|Established in 1948  the    Audio Engineering Society     AES  draws its membership from amongst engineers  scientists  other individuals with an interest or involvement in the   professional audio   industry  The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio  as well as persons working in audio content production  but also includes acousticians  audiologists  academics  and other disciplines related to audio  The AES is the only world wide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology   The organisation develops  reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries  and produces the    AES Conventions     which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the USA  The AES and individual regional or national  Sections  also hold AES Conferences on different topics during the year   The AES publishes a peer reviewed journal  the   Journal of the Audio Engineering Society    JAES      History   The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting  but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E  Sherry  of Victoria  Texas  in the December 1947 issue of the magazine   Audio Engineering    A New York engineer  C J  LeBel  then published a letter in response the following month asking for interested persons to contact him   What came to be the AES was formed at an organizational meeting at RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February 17  1948  Its first membership meeting followed on March 11  drawing primarily from the area s broadcast and recording operations  The guest speaker at the first meeting was   Harry F  Olson    a prominent engineer and scientist at   RCA   and author of     Acoustical Engineering       From its New York beginnings the AES grew world wide and as of 31 October 2010 comprised 14215 members  4306 of whom are classified as students     AES Standards   The AES publishes a number of standards on the subject of both analog and digital audio recording  transmission  and or reproduction  Notable standards include      AES3    also commonly known as AES EBU  for digital audio interconnection     AES10    also commonly known as MADI  for multichannel digital audio interconnection     AES11   for digital audio synchronization     AES47   for sending AES3 digital audio data over   Asynchronous Transfer Mode   networks      AES48   on interconnections  grounding and EMC practices  and shields of connectors in audio eqipment containing active circuitry      AES53   for assigning absolute times to the time markers provided by AES47     AES Gold Medal recipients   The AES Gold Medal is the Society s highest honor  and given in recognition of outstanding achievements  sustained over a period of years  in the field of Audio Engineering  The award was established in 1971  it was formerly known as the John H  Potts Memorial

2798|Author Domain Signing Practices|In   computing       Author Domain Signing Practices        ADSP     is an optional extension to the   DKIM   E mail authentication scheme       formerly   DomainKeys       whereby a domain can publish the signing practices it adopts when relaying mail on behalf of associated authors  ADSP was adopted as a standards track RFC 5617 in August 2009      Concepts       Author address    The   author address   is the one defined in the  tt From  tt  header field defined in RFC 5322   In the unusual cases where more than one address is defined in that field  RFC 5322 provides for a  tt Sender  tt  field to be used instead   The domains in 5322   From   addresses are not necessarily the same as in the more elaborated   Purported Responsible Address   covered by   Sender ID   specified in RFC 4407  The domain in a 5322   From   address is also not necessarily the same as in the     envelope sender     address defined in RFC 5321  also known as   SMTP   MAIL FROM  envelope   From    5321   From    or  tt Return Path  tt   optionally protected by   Sender Policy Framework SPF   specified in RFC 4408      Author Domain Signature    An   Author Domain Signature    is a valid DKIM signature in which the domain name of the DKIM signing entity  i e   the    d    tag in the   DKIM Signature   header field  is the same as the domain name in the    author address      This binding recognizes a higher value for author domain signatures than other valid signatures that may happen to be found in a message  In facts  it proves that the entity that controls the DNS zone for the author  an hence also the destination of replies to the message s author  has    relayed    the author s message  Most likely  the author has submitted the message through the proper   message submission agent    Such message qualification can be verified independently of any published domain signing practice      Author Domain Signing Practices    The    practices    consists in a   Domain Name System DNS   record published by the author domain  For an author address  tt john doe example com  tt   it may be set as    adsp  domainkey example com   IN

mail sent independently of the organization will not be signed  ref  http   tools ietf org html rfc5617 appendix B 5 rfc5617 appendix B 5   ref    However explicitly that caveat is worded  it is not straightforward to understand the purpose and the limitations of ADSP  One of ADSP authors holds that it is better to publish private lists of   discardable   domains  maintained by competent people

2817|AutoFetch|  Context date October 2009      AutoFetch    is a mechanism for automatically tuning   object relational mapping   queries   Ali Ibrahim and William Cook at the University of Texas developed the idea of  AutoFetch  including an implementation for  http   sourceforge net projects autofetch Hibernate  and followed later by an implementation in   Ebean        Benefits         Improving the modularity of application code      AutoFetch uses the program state  typically the Call Stack  to classify queries  This means that AutoFetch can tune the same query depending on HOW it was called    For example  a Data Access API such as  code findCustomer int customerId   code  can be tuned differently depending on the callers of the method        Reducing the development and maintenance burden from Developers      Because AutoFetch automatically gathers the profiling information developers do not need to manually try and gather this information and apply performance optimizations to the code   AutoFetch can monitor the object graph usage so that if the usage changes the tuning of the query can change to suit  This reduces the code maintenance issues for developers and maintains optimal performance as usage changes over time      How it works    AutoFetch collects object graph usage when queries are executed  It collects the  profile  information which is later used to automatically tune the query on subsequent executions  The ORM query is tuned by determining and automatically adding the correct prefetch directives for each query   This improves the performance of the application by reducing  lazy loading   For ORMs that support partial objects AutoFetch can also tune the query by just including the properties that the application uses rather than all properties      Future directions    AutoFetch profiling can also be used to select optimal query strategies such as  array fetching  where object graph use is known to be uneven  typically weighted to the first object graphs in a list    This could lead to much more efficient and higher performing object graph traversal than is currently possible with current techniques employed by ORM tools      See also       Object relational mapping      Hibernate  Java  Hibernate      Ebean       External links      http   www cs utexas edu  aibrahim autofetch    http   sourceforge net projects autofetch     Category Object relational mapping

2824|AutoRun|   AutoRun    and the companion feature   AutoPlay   are components of the   Microsoft Windows     operating system   that dictate what actions the system takes when a drive is   Mount  computing  mounted     AutoRun was introduced in   Windows 95   to ease application installation for non technical users and reduce the cost of software support calls  When an appropriately configured   CD ROM   is inserted into a CD ROM drive  Windows detects the arrival and checks the contents for a special file containing a set of instructions  For a commercial application  these instructions normally initiate installation of the software from the CD ROM  To maximise the likelihood of installation success  AutoRun also acts when the drive is accessed     double click  ed   in   Windows Explorer    or  My Computer     Until the introduction of   Windows XP    the terms AutoRun and AutoPlay were used interchangeably  developers often using the former term and end users the latter  This tendency is reflected in Windows Policy settings named AutoPlay that change Windows Registry entries named AutoRun  and in the   autorun inf   file which causes  AutoPlay  to be added to drives    context menu  s  The terminology was of little importance until the arrival of Windows XP and its addition of a new feature to assist users in selecting appropriate actions when new media and devices were detected  This new feature was called   AutoPlay   and a differentiation between the two terms was created  ref name autoplaydiff  http   windowshelp microsoft com Windows en us help a19ac945

devices and  based on content such as pictures  music or video files  launches an appropriate application to play or display the content  ref name autoplaydiff   If available  settings in an autorun inf file can add to the options presented to the user   AutoPlay is based on a set of handler applications registered with the AutoPlay system  Each media type  Pictures  Music  Video  can have a set of registered handlers which can deal with playing or display that type of media   Each hardware device can have a default action occurring on discovery of a particular media type  or the AutoPlay dialog can prompt the user what action to take      AutoRun activation     The AutoRun sequence starts with the initial discovery of a new device or new piece of media  Following this  notification of interested parties occurs  of which the Windows Explorer shell is of primary interest  After checking certain   Windows Registry Registry   settings to see if AutoRun can proceed  parsing of an optional autorun inf may occur and any necessary actions are taken  not working   The initial sequence is handled much the same in every version of Windows from Windows 95  However  the way the autorun inf file is read and acted upon and the level of integration of AutoRun with AutoPlay has changed significantly from the time AutoPlay was introduced in Windows XP until the present handling

AutoPlay in Windows XP  the final stage action  stage 7 above  for some drive types changed from executing an application to invoking AutoPlay  From Windows Vista  the AutoPlay system is integrated into every aspect of media handling and there is no automatic execution of the AutoRun task   The default Registry settings add Removable drives to those that initiated AutoRun  In Windows XP and higher    except   Windows Server 2003  only the Unknown and Remote drive types are not active for AutoRun   The handling of the autorun inf file changes very significantly between each Windows version  The details can be found in the   autorun inf Inf handling autorun inf   article  The current handling in Windows 7 is that   only   drives of type DRIVE CDROM may specify an AutoRun task  alter double click behaviour or change context menus       The AutoPlay safety net      It would appear that AutoPlay  by transferring control of what were previously automatic and invisible actions to AutoPlay  acts to increase user control and safety  This applies especially from Windows Vista  where all media and devices fall under AutoPlay control   However  it is important to note that     A user can instruct AutoPlay to make automatic choices on their behalf  including the execution of any AutoRun task     When a user double clicks on the drive icon in Explorer or right clicks to get a context menu  what happens next is fully programmable by the autorun inf file and is essentially outside AutoPlay s purview  This is true under any Windows operating system     Disabling AutoRun may force a user to double click the drive icon to get a contents list  thus actually increasing the chance of malware infiltration      Registry settings     AutoRun consults   Windows Registry   values to decide whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type  These values can be changed using several methods  one of which is using   Group policy Group Policy     The primary relevant Registry entry names are  tt NoDriveTypeAutoRun  tt  and  tt NoDriveAutoRun  tt   These exist in both per machine and per user settings and their location and priority in the Registry are

torn over whether any of this was necessary given the existence of the Windows Registry article but I decided to do it anyway  I may make some additions to the registry article and remove this section at a later date  Carveone       The Windows Registry is a hierarchical   directory  database  database   that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system  The terminology is somewhat misleading so it is briefly summarised here   A Registry   key   is similar to a folder that  in addition to values  each key can contain subkeys which in turn may contain subkeys  and so on   A Registry   value   consists of a name data pair  Microsoft documentation commonly uses the term  entry  as an equivalent term  It also uses  value  for  data  when it is obvious what is meant  To avoid confusion  this article always uses the term  entry  when referring to the name data pair   Two Registry keys that are very commonly referred to are  tt HKEY LOCAL MACHINE  tt  which contains per machine settings  and  tt HKEY CURRENT USER  tt  which contains settings for the currently logged on user  These are almost always abbreviated as  tt HKLM  tt  and  tt HKCU  tt  respectively  There may be many users of a machine  their settings are stored in  tt HKEY USERS  tt    tt HKCU  tt  is actually just a link to the appropriate place in  tt HKEY USERS  tt        Changing Registry settings      Registry settings may be changed directly by using the GUI  tt regedit  tt  tool or the command line  tt reg exe  tt  utility  Settings can also be placed in a    Registry files text

machine setting  under HKEY LOCAL MACHINE   If an entry appears under HKEY LOCAL MACHINE  then any corresponding entry under HKEY CURRENT USER is completely ignored  The data values are not merged in any way   When deciding whether to activate AutoRun  both  tt NoDriveAutoRun  tt  and  tt NoDriveTypeAutoRun  tt  Registry entries are consulted  If either value indicates a drive should be disabled then AutoRun is disabled for that drive   Thus in the following example      class  wikitable  style  margin 1 5em 1em 1 5em 2em        colspan  2    HKEY LOCAL MACHINE        colspan  2    HKEY

released and was the first released version of AutoTURN compatible with   Bentley Systems     MicroStation     Unix    The libraries of vehicles available for  http   en wiktionary org wiki swept path  swept path    simulation   and analysis was limited and vehicle simulations could only be carried out in a forward direction  AutoTURN 2 0 was compatible with AutoCAD Release 10 and then   Unix   version of MicroStation V 3 4    AutoTURN 3 0 was released in   1993    less than 1 year after AutoTURN 2 0  The 3 0 release version of AutoTURN included many upgrades over its predecessor  This version of AutoTURN included larger vehicle libraries  and a supplement for use with aircraft  This supplement would become expanded into a separate software called AutoTURN Aircraft in   1995     Among other improvements  AutoTURN 3 0 enabled users to run simultaneous   simulation  s of two vehicles in forward and reverse directions in a stop motion  frame by frame  animation  Simulations could only be done from pre drawn paths    In   2000   the release of AutoTURN 4 0 accounted for international users  it was the first version of AutoTURN available in multiple languages  Among other improvements  AutoTURN 4 0 included expanded international libraries of vehicles  To incorporate the many new capabilities it was necessary to make significant changes to the program s visual   User interface interface   and functionality  The change in interface included a new   toolbar    Generate simulation tools were introduced so users didn t first have to draw the vehicle path in order to generate a simulation  AutoTURN 4 introduced the concepts of Active Path and Active Simulation allowing for repetition of various functions without repeated re selecting of objects  Like the previous release versions  AutoTURN 4 0 contained a supplement for aircraft    AutoTURN 5 0 s release in 2004  among many other functions  introduced   Heuristic     algorithm  s for tracking  creation of simulations on spline elements  and improved layer management for simulations  The standard vehicle library file was changed to a searchable   database   of vehicles based on international or custom standards  Adding to those features AutoTURN 5 1 introduces the ability to set Steering Linkage ratios between the front and rear steering axle groups  Additionally  in the 5 1 version could continuously loop simulations    The 2008 release of AutoTURN 6 0 added additional simulation functions  It builds on version 5 1 s abilities to loop simulations by adding the ability to export

2829|Autocatalytic set|  Unreferenced date January 2011   An    autocatalytic set    is a collection of entities  each of which can be created   catalysis catalytically   by other entities within the set  such that as a whole  the set is able to catalyze its own production   In this way the set   as a whole   is said to be   autocatalysis autocatalytic      Autocatalytic sets were originally and most concretely defined in terms of   molecular entity molecular entities    but have more recently been metaphorically extended to the study of systems in   sociology   and   economics     Autocatalytic sets also have the ability to replicate themselves if they are split apart into two physically separated spaces  Computer models illustrate that split autocatalytic sets will reproduce all of the reactions of the original set in each half  much like cellular   mitosis    In effect  using the principles of autocatalysis  a small metabolism can replicate itself with very little high level organization  This property is why autocatalysis is a contender as the foundational mechanism for complex evolution   Prior to   Watson and Crick    biologists considered autocatalytic sets the way   metabolism   functions in principle  i e  one   protein   helps to synthesize another protein and so on  After the discovery of the   double helix    the   central dogma of molecular biology   was formulated  which is that   DNA   is transcribed to   RNA   which is translated to protein  The molecular structure of DNA and RNA  as well as the metabolism that maintains their reproduction  are believed to be too complex to have arisen spontaneously in one step from a soup of chemistry   Several models of the origin of life are based on the notion that life may have arisen through the development of an initial molecular autocatalytic set which evolved over time   Most of these models which have emerged from the studies of   complex system  s predict that life arose not from a molecule with any particular trait  such as self replicating   RNA World RNA    but from an autocatalytic set  The first empirical support came from Lincoln and Joyce  who obtained autocatalytic sets in which  two  RNA  enzymes catalyze each other s synthesis from a total of four component substrates   ref   cite journal   author   Lincoln TA  Joyce GF   title   Self sustained replication of an RNA enzyme   journal   Science   volume   323   issue   5918   pages   1229 32   year   2009   month   February   pmid   19131595   pmc   2652413   doi   10 1126 science 1167856   url     issn       ref  Furthermore  an evolutionary process that began with a population of these self replicators yielded a population dominated by   recombination recombinant   replicators   Modern life has the traits of an autocatalytic set  since no particular molecule  nor any class of molecules  is able to replicate itself  There are several models based on autocatalytic sets  including those of   Stuart Kauffman   and others     Formal definition    Given a set M of   molecule  s    chemical reaction  s can be roughly defined as pairs r  A  B  of subsets from M     a sub 1  sub    a sub 2  sub          a sub n  sub    b sub 1  sub    b sub 2  sub          b sub m  sub   Let R be the set of allowable reactions  A pair  M  R  is a   reaction system    RS    A molecule m   A   B of a reaction r is a   catalyst   of this reaction   A RS is   autocatalytic    if all the catalysts for all its reactions are in M   The above definition is not sufficient to describe dependency on external resources or nutrients  This can be formulated by a   closure  mathematics  closure   over a generating subset of M   Formally  cl S  denotes the smallest subset Y of M that contains S such that for each reaction  A  B     A   S   Y   B   Y  A RS is   generated    over some resources S   if all reactants A in its reactions are in cl S  and none of the resources is a catalyst   A   generated autocatalytic set   is an RS that is both autocatalytic and generated     Probability that a random set is autocatalytic    Studies of the above model show that random RS can be autocatalytic with high probability under some assumptions  This comes from the fact that with a growing number of molecules  the number of possible reactions and catalysations grows even larger if the molecules grow in complexity  producing stochastically enough reactions and catalysations to make a part of the RS self supported   Clarify date January 2011   An autocatalytic set then extends very quickly with growing number of molecules for the same reason  These theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive for scientific explanation of the very early origin of life     Formal limitations    Formally  it is difficult to treat molecules as anything but unstructured entities  since the set of possible reactions  and molecules  would become infinite  Therefore  a derivation of arbitrarily long   polymer  s as needed to model DNA  RNA or proteins is not possible  yet  Studies of the   RNA World   suffer from the same problem     Linguistic aspects    Contrary to the above definition  which applies to the field of   Artificial chemistry    no agreed upon notion of autocatalytic sets exists today   While above  the notion of catalyst is secondary insofar that only the set as a whole has to catalyse its own production  it is primary in other definitions  giving the term  Autocatalytic Set  a different emphasis  There    every   reaction  or function  transformation  has to be mediated by a catalyst  As a consequence  while mediating its respective reaction  every catalyst   denotes   its reaction  too  resulting in a self denoting system  which is interesting for two reasons  First  real metabolism is structured in this manner  Second  self denoting systems can be considered as an intermediate step towards self describing systems   From both a structural and a natural historical point of view  one can identify the ACS as seized in the formal definition the more original concept  while in the second  the reflection of the system in itself is already brought to an explicit presentation  since catalysts represent the reaction induced by them  In ACS literature  both concept are present  but differently emphasised   To complete the classification from the other side  generalised self reproducing systems move beyond self denotation  There  no unstructured entities carry the transformations anymore  but structured  described ones  Formally  a generalised self reproducing system consists of two function  u and c  together with their descriptions Desc u  and Desc c  along following definition        u   Desc X     X      c   Desc X     Desc X   where the function  u  is the   Universal Constructor  universal  constructor    that constructs everything in its domain from appropriate descriptions  while  c  is a copy function for any description  Practically   u  and  c  can fall apart into many subfunctions or catalysts   Note that the  trivial  copy function  c  is necessary because though the universal constructor  u  would be able to construct any description  too  the description it would base on  would in general be longer than the result  rendering full self replication impossible   This last concept can be attributed to   John von Neumann von Neumann   s work on   Self replication self reproducing   automata  where he holds a self description necessary for any non trivial  generalised  self reproducing system to avoid interferences  Von Neumann planned to design such a system for a model chemistry  too     Non autonomous autocatalytic sets    Virtually all articles on autocatalytic sets leave open whether the sets are to be considered autonomous or not  Often  autonomy of the sets is silently assumed   Likely  the above context has a strong emphasis on autonomous self replication and early origin of life  But the concept of autocatalytic sets is really more general and in practical use in various technical areas  e g  where self sustaining tool chains are handled  Clearly  such sets are not autonomous and are objects of human agency   Examples of practical importance of non autonomous autocatalytic sets can be found e g  in the field of   Bootstrapping  compilers  compiler construction   and in   Self hosting operating systems    where the self referential nature of the respective constructions is explicitly discussed  very often in terms of the   chicken and egg   problem     References     Reflist

2932|Automorphic form|In   mathematics    the general notion of    automorphic form    is the extension to   analytic function  s  perhaps of   several complex variables    of the theory of   modular form  s  It is in terms of a   Lie group    math G  math   to generalise the groups   SL2 R  SL sub 2  sub     R       or   PSL2 R  PSL sub 2  sub      R       of modular forms  and a   discrete group    math   Gamma  subset G  math   to generalise the   modular group    or one of its   congruence subgroup  s     Formulation    The formulation requires the general notion of   factor of automorphy    math j  math  for  math   Gamma   math   which is a type of 1 cocycle in the language of   group cohomology    The values of  math j  math  may be complex numbers  or in fact complex square matrices  corresponding to the possibility of vector valued automorphic forms  The cocycle condition imposed on the factor of automorphy is something that can be routinely checked  when  math j  math  is derived from a   Jacobian matrix    by means of the   chain rule     In the general setting  then  an automorphic form is a function  math  F   math  on  math G  math   with values in some fixed finite dimensional vector space  math V  math   in the vector valued case   subject to three kinds of conditions    to transform under translation by elements  math  gamma  in  Gamma   math  according to the given automorphy factor  math j  math    to be an eigenfunction of certain   Casimir operator  s on  math G  math   and  to satisfy some conditions on   growth at infinity     It is the first of these that makes  math  F   math    automorphic    that is  satisfy an interesting   functional equation   relating  math  F g    math  with  math F  gamma g    math  for  math  gamma  in  Gamma   math   In the vector valued case the specification can involve a finite dimensional   group representation     acting on the components to  twist  them  The Casimir operator condition says that some   Laplacian  s have  math  F   math  as eigenfunction  this ensures that  math  F   math  has excellent analytic properties  but whether it is actually a complex analytic function depends on the particular case  The third condition is to handle the case where  math  G   Gamma   math  is not   compact space compact   but has   Cusp form cusp  s     History    Before this very general setting was proposed  around 1960   there had already been substantial developments of automorphic forms other than modular forms  The case of  math   Gamma   math  a   Fuchsian group   had already received attention before 1900  see below   The   Hilbert modular form  s  Hilbert Blumenthal  as one should say  were proposed not long after that  though a full theory was long in coming  The   Siegel modular form  s  for which  math  G   math  is a   symplectic group    arose naturally from considering   moduli space  s and   theta function  s  The post war interest in several complex variables made it natural to pursue the idea of automorphic form in the cases where the forms are indeed complex analytic  Much work was done  in particular by   Ilya Piatetski Shapiro    in the years around 1960  in creating such a theory  The theory of the   Selberg trace formula    as applied by others  showed the considerable depth of the theory    Robert Langlands   showed how  in generality  many particular cases being known  the   Riemann Roch theorem   could be applied to the calculation of dimensions of automorphic forms  this is a kind of   post hoc   check on the validity of the notion  He also produced the general theory of   real analytic Eisenstein series Eisenstein series    which corresponds to what in   spectral theory   terms would be the  continuous spectrum  for this problem  leaving the   cusp form   or discrete part to investigate  From the point of view of number theory  the cusp forms had been recognised  since   Srinivasa Ramanujan    as the heart of the matter     Automorphic representations    The subsequent notion of    automorphic representation    has proved of great technical value for dealing with  math  G   math  an   algebraic group    treated as an   adelic algebraic group    It does not completely include the automorphic form idea introduced above  in that the   Adele ring adele   approach is a way of dealing with the whole family of   congruence subgroup  s at once  Inside an  math L 2   math  space for a quotient of the adelic form of  math  G   math   an automorphic representation is a representation that is an infinite   tensor product   of representations of   p adic group  s  with specific   enveloping algebra    dn   representations for the   infinite prime   s   One way to express the shift in emphasis is that the   Hecke operator  s are here in effect put on the same level as the Casimir operators  which is natural from the point of view of   functional analysis    though not so obviously for the number theory  It is this concept that is basic to the formulation of the   Langlands philosophy        Poincar  on psychology of discovery and his work on automorphic functions     Poincar  s first area of interest in mathematics  dating to the 1880s  was automorphic forms  He named them Fuchsian functions  after the mathematician   Lazarus Fuchs    because Fuchs was known for being a good teacher and had researched on differential equations and the theory of functions  Poincar  actually developed the concept of these functions as part of his doctoral thesis  Under Poincar  s definition  an automorphic function is one which is analytic in its domain and is invariant under a denumerable infinite group of linear fractional transformations  Automorphic functions then generalize both trigonometric and elliptic functions   Poincar  explains how he discovered Fuchsian functions      For fifteen days I strove to prove that there could not be any functions like those I have since called Fuchsian functions  I was then very ignorant  every day I seated myself at my work table  stayed an hour or two  tried a great number of combinations and reached no results  One evening  contrary to my custom  I drank black coffee and could not sleep  Ideas rose in crowds  I felt them collide until pairs interlocked  so to speak  making a stable combination  By the next morning I had established the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions  those which come from the hypergeometric series  I had only to write out the results  which took but a few hours       See also       Automorphic factor

2948|Autonomous research robot|The Denning Mobile Robot company of Boston was the first to offer ready made autonomous robots  which were purchased primarily by researchers  Grinnell More s Real World Interface  Inc   RWI  and James Slater s Nomadic Technologies in the US and Francesco Mondada s K Team in Switzerland were also among the pioneers to address the need for ready made robots for robotics researchers with the B 21 from RWI  XR4000 from Nomadic and tiny   Khepera mobile robot   from K Team  however  prices meant that only a few graduate students and military researchers could afford them  The low cost Pioneer robot was introduced by a collaboration between RWI and   ActivMedia Robotics   in 1995  making robots available to many and opening the floodgates to new research in mobile robotics   By 1999  the Denning company was defunct  In 1998  RWI joined with ISRobotics to form the   iRobot   corporation  There Grinnell More introduced the   PackBot   remote control robot  veering away from autonomous development and research robots to pursue military venues  Nomadic Technologies also left the field    MobileRobots Inc   and K Team continued to build on autonomy and provide for the research community   In 2003 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  contracted with Segway to convert fifteen   Segway PT  s into Segway Robotic Mobility Platforms  Segway developed the platform to serve as a reliable  cost effective tool for research institutions and delivered the units to DARPA in April  In June 2003 DARPA worked with SPAWAR Systems Center  San Diego to distribute the units to 14 government and university research institutions to use in robotic research projects  ref http   www segway com downloads pdfs Segway Company Milestones pdf  ref      Autonomous navigation techniques     Image ActivMedia Pioneer 3 AT robot jpg thumb An ActivMedia Pioneer 3 AT robot at the   Georgia Institute of Technology     Research robots made great strides in autonomous indoor navigation between the 1990s and the 2000s  Currently  a number of ready made research bases have the sensing  mobility  and computational power necessary for such autonomy  The Pioneer    PatrolBot    PowerBot and PeopleBot platforms can map buildings and navigate out of the box  using   Simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM   and a variation on   Monte Carlo method   Markov localization and modified value iterated search navigation techniques  with any sensor of the 2 D range finder class  This method creates a human readable map of the robot s workspace that can be used to control and track robots of this type as they move    Evolution Robotics   offers single camera VSLAM software  which replaces range finding with visual pattern matching  but this system cannot create a human readable map with which to monitor robots  position  Other groups are building stereocam based VSLAM  Because the stereocam provides range finding data using the disparity between the lenses  maps can be made and robots tracked  The   khepera mobile robot K Team Khepera    Segway based platforms and other research robots can link to external computing resources to use such software   The precision of any of these methods depends upon the precision of the sensor  the granularity of data tracked and the speed of calculation  Range finding lasers may have    1 cm accuracy while digital stereocamera accuracy is limited to a quarter pixel and thus is highly range dependent  Vision based systems require more computational resources than simple range finding systems such as lasers  but may do the computation on a digital signal processor embedded with the camera  Because of cost and precision trade offs  less expensive vision based systems tend to be used on consumer robots while commercial and industrial robots and automated guided vehicles  AGVs  tend to use laser based systems   Outdoors  localization is primarily handled with GPS  however  satellite signals can frequently be lost due to weather  trees  buildings or other obstructions  When the signal is lost  the robot typically navigates using dead reckoning and inertial motion tracking  Dead reckoning relies on relative wheel motion and is highly subject to cumulative slippage errors  Inertial motion tracking uses rate gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine actual motion of the platform  The accuracy of inertial motion tracking depends upon the quality and calibration of the sensors employed  The Segway RMP 400 and Seekur robots are two of the few research platforms designed for such research  most other outdoor research robots are jerry rigged by researchers from existing vehicles   In constrained areas  some robots  such as the John Deere Gator  simply surround the perimeter with radio beacons and use simple triangulation from three or more beacons to localize and navigate  Beacons are also used indoors by older AGVs in factories   Autonomous Solutions is a leader in the field of outdoor navigation software  their system is used by John Deere tractors and by some military platforms     Programming research robots   Much research software for autonomous robots is   Free Software   or   Open Source Software    including Carmen from Carnegie Mellon  Player Stage Gazebo from the University of Southern California and the  http   robots mobilerobots com ARIA API libraries  from MobileRobots  Inc  There is also commercial software    Webots   has been continuously developed since 1998 and is currently used by more than 500 universities  It runs on Linux  Windows and Mac OS X  More recently  in June 2006  Microsoft Research began offering free beta test copies of a Robotics Studio software development kit with Pioneer robots in simulation for Windows XP in an attempt to counter Linux dominance onboard mobile robot platforms  An older platform    URBI   with a   Free Software   SDK is used in many universities  The plethora of autonomous mobile robots and software available for researchers has greatly sped the pace of development in the robotics field     References    references      DEFAULTSORT Autonomous

2958|Autopoiesis|  Wiktionarypar autopoiesis      Autopoiesis    literally means  auto  self  creation   from the   Greek language Greek             auto   for  self   and             poiesis   for  creation or production    and expresses a fundamental   dialectic   between   structure   and   function  engineering  function       Meaning   The term was originally introduced by Chilean biologists   Humberto Maturana   and   Francisco Varela   in 1972   blockquote  p An autopoietic machine is a machine organized  defined as a unity  as a network of processes of production  transformation and destruction  of components which   i  through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes  relations  that produced them  and  ii  constitute it  the machine  as a concrete unity in space in which they  the components  exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network  ref Maturana  Varela  1980  p  78  ref   p    p       the space defined by an autopoietic system is self contained and cannot be described by using dimensions that define another space  When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system  however  we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection  ref Maturana  Varela  1980  p  89  ref   p   blockquote   The term   autopoiesis   was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of   living systems    A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the   biological cell    The   eukaryote eukaryotic   cell  for example  is made of various biochemical components such as   nucleic acid  s and   protein  s  and is organized into bounded structures such as the   cell nucleus    various   organelle  s  a   cell membrane   and   cytoskeleton    These structures  based on an external flow of molecules and energy    produce   the components which  in turn  continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components    An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an   allopoietic   system  such as a car factory  which uses raw materials  components  to generate a car  an organized structure  which is something   other   than itself  the factory    Even though others have often used the term as a synonym for   self organization    Maturana himself stated he would  never use the notion of self organization  because it cannot be the case     it is impossible  That is  if the organization of a thing changes  the thing changes   ref Maturana  H   1987   Everything is said by an observer  In Gaia  a Way of Knowing  edited by W  Thompson   Lindisfarne Press  Great Barrington  MA  pp  65 82  p  71   ref  Moreover  an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed  in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole  Autopoietic systems are  structurally coupled  with their medium  embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as   sensory motor coupling    This continuous dynamic is considered as at least a rudimentary form of   knowledge   or   cognition   and can be observed throughout life forms   An application of the concept to   sociology   can be found in   Niklas Luhmann Theory Niklas Luhmann   s   Systems theory Sociology and Sociocybernetics Systems Theory    which was subsequently adapted by   Bob Jessop   in his studies of the capitalist state system    Marjatta Maula   adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context     Criticism   Criticism of the use of the term in both its original use  as an attempt to define and explain the living  and its various expanded usages such as applying it to self organizing systems in general  or social systems  in particular have been widespread  ref Fleischaker  G   Ed    1992   Autopoiesis in Systems Analysis  A Debate  Int  J  General Systems  Vol  21  No 2  pp  131 271  ref  Critics have argued that the term fails to define or explain living systems and that  because of the extreme language of   self referential  ity it uses without any external reference  it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana s radical   constructivist epistemology constructivist   or   solipsistic     epistemology   ref Swenson  R   1992   Autocatakinetics  Yes   Autopoiesis  No

2985|Average case complexity|   Average case complexity    is a subfield of   computational complexity   theory that studies the complexity of algorithms on random inputs   The study of average case complexity has applications in the theory of   cryptography       Leonid Levin   presented the motivation for studying average case complexity as follows  ref  http   www cs bu edu fac lnd research hard htm  Intractability Concepts for Concrete Problems     Leonid Levin     ref     Many combinatorial problems  called search or NP problems  have easy methods of checking solutions for correctness  Examples  finding factors of a long integer  or proofs of math theorems or short fast programs generating a given string  Such problems can be stated as a task to invert a given  easy to compute  function  multiplication or extraction of a theorem from its proof   In 1971 I noticed that many such problems can be proven to be as hard as the Tiling problem  which  I knew for a while  was universal  i e  at least as hard as any search problem       A common misinterpretation of these results was that all NP complete problems are hard  no chance for good algorithms  On this basis some such problems generated much hope in cryptography  the adversary would be helpless  Karp and others noticed that this was naive  While worst instances of NP complete problems defeat our algorithms  such instances may be extremely rare  In fact  fast on average algorithms were found for a great many NP complete problems  If all NP problems are easy on average  the P  NP question becomes quite academic  Even if exponentially hard instances exist  those we could ever find might all be easy  Some problems  like factoring  seem hard for typical instances  but nothing is proven at all to support this  crucial  e g   for cryptography  belief  These issues turned out to be subtle and it was not clear how a theory could distinguish intrinsically hard on average problems   Levin 86    Venkatesan  Levin STOC 88    Impagliazzo  Levin  FOCS 90  proposed such a theory with first average case intractability results  Random  under uniform distribution  instances of some problems are now known to be as hard as random instances of any NP problem under any samplable distribution      Related topics       Probabilistic analysis of algorithms      Literature    The literature of average

3057|BASICODE|  Image basicode jpg 300px thumb BASICODE s    Esperanto   for computers  claim  from the   East Germany East German   publication   radio fernsehen elektronik         BASICODE    was a computer project intended to create a unified standard for the   BASIC     programming language    BASIC was available on many popular   home computer  s  but there were countless variants that were mostly   computer compatibility incompatible   with each other  The project was initiated in 1980 by Hobbyscoop  a radio program off the   Netherlands   broadcasting organisation   Nederlandse Omroep Stichting    NOS    The basic implementation were architecture specific utility applications that executed calls of   subroutines   for text  audio and sound defined in the BASICODE language standard according to the abilities of the computer in question  These applications  called   Bascoders    also enabled the sharing of data and programs across different computer platforms by defining a data format for the   compact audio cassette  s that were regularly used as storage media in the 1980s  A BASICODE program stored on cassette could be loaded and run on any computer supporting the language  BASICODE was often called    Esperanto   for computers  for that reason     BASICODE      The situation at the beginning of the 1980s      Image Commodore64 jpg thumb right Commodore 64     Image Atari 800XL Plain White jpg thumb right Atari 800 XL    From the late 1970s to the late 1980s   home computers   based on 8 bit processors were very popular  Among the most well known models were the   TRS 80   by   Tandy    the   PET 2001      VIC 20      Commodore 64 C64      Commodore 128 C128   and the   Commodore Plus 4 Plus 4   by   Commodore International Commodore    the   Atari     Atari 8 bit family 400 800  XL XE     the   Sinclair Research   computers    Sinclair ZX80 ZX80      Sinclair ZX81 ZX81      ZX Spectrum    and the   KC 85 KC85 family   popular in the   German Democratic Republic    All these computers had a   CPU   of the   MOS Technology 6502   or   Zilog Z80   type  16 to 64   kilobyte     random access memory RAM    connectors for a cassette drive or a built in one for data storage  and finally a   BASIC     Interpreter  computing  interpreter   that was generally stored in   read only memory ROM    The flat learning curve of BASIC  which had been designed with newcomers to programming in mind  and the instant availability of the language on all these computers led to many users writing and sharing their own programs   A problem was that sharing programs and data across computers by different manufacturers was difficult because the various BASIC dialects were totally incompatible in some areas  They used different BASIC commands to make the same action  like clearing the screen  drawing a pixel or playing a sound   so that a BASIC program written for the C64 did not work on an Atari XL without modification and vice versa  Another difficulty was the fact that while these computers were similar  they still differed in key hardware aspects like screen resolution  available color palette or audio abilities  Finally  the data formats used for storing data on cassette were incompatible as well      The first standard      Image ZXSpectrum48k jpg thumb right Sinclair ZX Spectrum   Around 1980 the Netherlands broadcaster NOS began transmitting computer programs by radio  Because programs and data were stored as audio on compact cassettes  it was possible to record such a broadcast on tape and load it into the computer later  However  because of the problems mentioned earlier  the program had to be adapted for nearly all popular types of computers and broadcasted multiple times as well  Because the compact cassette has a very low data density compared to today s storage media  the recording of the programs took quite a long time  and only a limited number of programs could be broadcast per show  So  the additional broadcasting of different versions of the same programs was a great inconvenience   In 1982 the executives at NOS decided to develop a unified data format  An application that was specific for each computer model  called   Bascoder    managed the recall and storage of programs and data in this unified format from tape  The Bascoders were broadcast by NOS as well  but could also be bought from NOS on cassette and shared among friends and acquaintances  The format  which was very well protected against interference  could be read and written by all popular home computer hardware  The robustness of the format also made broadcasting via   mediumwave   radio possible  which increased the range and in turn the number of potential users  For example  data broadcast by the Netherlands station TROS    Televisie en Radio Omroep Stichting    also known as   Radio Hilversum    could be received in large parts of the   German Democratic Republic        BASICODE 2      Image Sinclair ZX81 jpg thumb right ZX81     Image Apple II jpg thumb right Apple II   The standard solved one of the aforementioned problems  the incompatible data formats  However  programs still had to be adapted to each computer s BASIC dialect and hardware capabilities  Limiting the programs to only use instructions common across all dialects meant big limitations in terms of functionality  for example completely refraining from using graphics and sound and only uncomfortable methods to input data using the keyboard and to control character output on the screen  For this reasons  in 1984 the enhanced standard BASICODE 2 was created  Bascoders using this standard did not only contain routines for input and output of data to tape  In addition to a set of about 50 BASIC commands  functions and operators that were common across all BASIC dialects  the language standard of BASCODE 2 defined a library of subroutines that emulated the same capabilities across all supported computers   To achieve this  all program lines below 1000 were reserved for the Bascoder  and BASICODE programs could only start at line number 1000  The subroutines of the Bascoder in the lines below 1000 were called with a   GOSUB   command  Necessary arguments were passed to the Bascoder by using special predefined variables that were reserved for use by the Bascoder  The standard contained a number of additional rules that were made necessary by the limitations of some computer models  For example  on the ZX 81 a line of code could only contain a single BASIC command  a behaviour that almost no other computer shared  On a KC series computer  a line of code could not be longer than 60 characters  These limitations had to be enforced for all BASICODE programs to guarantee platform independence  because the Bascoder was interpreted by the same computer specific BASIC interpreter as the BASICODE program itself   Thus  the Bascoders were loaded on the various computers like normal programs and provided the additional routines for the common standard and cassette I O afterwards  Programs written in BASICODE were only usable after the Bascoder had been loaded and started  However  on some computers the BASICODE programs could be merged with the routines of the Bascoders and saved in the native data format  The resulting program was not platform independent any longer  but due to the higher data density of most native formats it could be loaded much faster than the same program in BASICODE format  Also  because it was not necessary to load the complete Bascoder to run the program  more RAM remained available at run time   There were BASICODE 2 Bascoders for the   Exidy Sorcerer      Colour Genie      Commodore PET      Commodore VIC 20 VIC 20      Commodore 64 C64      Amiga      Sinclair ZX81      ZX Spectrum      Sinclair QL QL      Acorn Atom      BBC Micro Micro      Acorn Electron Electron    Tandy   TRS 80      MSX      Oric Atmos      P2000T      Grundy NewBrain      Amstrad CPC      IBM PC      Apple II      Texas Instruments TI 99 4A      Mattel Aquarius   and others  Additionally  advanced users were able to write their own Bascoder for their system of choice  since the language standard and data format were open and well documented  The BASICODE 2 standard made the development of platform independent programs with advanced capabilities  for the time  possible  In addition  BASICODE was used to transmit and share information like computer scene news via radio in the form of so called  journals   A BASICODE coding tutorial and other documentation was transmitted this way as well      BASICODE 3   3C     In 1986  the new BASICODE 3 standard was developed  The most important additions were routines for simple   monochrome   graphics  reading and writing data from within programs and sound output  BASICODE 3 made BASICODE popular in the computer scene of the GDR  and from 1989 onward BASICODE programs were transmitted via radio throughout the GDR  Also  a book was published which included a vinyl record with Bascoders for all computers common in the GDR  The last revision of BASICODE  which featured color graphics  was released as BASICODE 3C in 1991      The end of BASICODE     From about 1990 onward the popularity of BASICODE declined rapidly due to the rise of 16  and 32 bit computers  especially IBM PC variants and compatible systems  Even though there were Bascoders for these machines  BASICODE was too limited to make use of the resources that that generation of computers provided  Additionally  because of the much fewer common architectures in the 16  and 32 bit era  the main reason for the development and use of BASICODE became moot  As the hardware and software of the new systems became more and more complex  most users became unable or disinclined to write programs  The rise of   graphical user interfaces   contributed to the decline in popularity of 8 bit computers and consequently BASICODE as well   The successor of the GDR s state broadcaster  the   Deutschlandsender Deutschlandsender Kultur    which later became part of the new   Deutschlandradio     continued to broadcast BASICODE programs until about 1992  A planned standard called BASICODE 4 never became reality  because NOS stopped supporting the project shortly after BASICODE 3C was released  BASICODE is still used by enthusiasts  in particular 8 bit computer fans  for nostalgic value  but is not of any practical relevance     Historical significance    BASICODE was an early attempt at creating a standard for the exchange of programs and data across mutually incompatible home computer architectures  It is roughly contemporary to the   MSX   standard developed by   Microsoft    which specified a shared hardware platform in addition to a common BASIC dialect  These computers were sold by multiple companies and directly competed with other popular home computers  MSX was successful mostly in the home markets of the manufacturers  for example   Japan      South Korea    the   Netherlands   and   Brasil    Unlike MSX  BASICODE defined no hardware  but a language standard for the programming language BASIC  which mas near ubiquitous in home computers  plus a data format for   Compact Cassette  s which could be read and written on all computers for which BASICODE was available  As a result  the implementation of BASICODE was exclusively dependent on additional software and thus was not limited to computers by specific manufacturers  The   installed base   of BASICODE is hard to estimate  because both the Bascoders and the programs written in BASICODE were freely available  There was a Bascoder for nearly every home computer sold during this era  Commercially  BASICODE was of no importance because it was always shared for free   It must be stated that BASICODE was  by design  unable to use the capabilities of the host computers to their full extent  The language standard defined by BASICODE was the lowest common denominator of all relevant computer systems  This concept was partially abandoned only with BASICODE3 3C  as some computers or computer variants like the   ZX80     ZX81   and the   KC87   were not capable of graphics and color and the new sections of BASICODE using these capabilities were not usable on them  Especially for applications that relied on timing and graphics or sound  for example   computer games    BASICODE was clearly inferior to programs written in  native  BASIC or   machine code    The strengths of BASICODE were in the areas of application design  education software and data sharing  The BASICODE format was also used for   Pascal  programming language  Pascal   programs  Pascal was a much more consistent language across systems  but compilers were available only for very few types of home computers   The underlying concept of BASICODE  which is the definition of a language standard for platform independent software development and the implementation of said standard as system specific runtimes  Bascoder  was later revisited in the programming language   Java  programming language  Java    in the form of the   operating system   specific   Java Virtual Machine  s which execute Java programs  Additionally  the distribution of data and information in the BASICODE data format is reminiscent of current platform agnostic document types like the   Portable Document Format    PDF  and the PDF reader applications it necessitates     The BASICODE data format     Image Basicode2 jpg 200px thumb A BASICODE compact audio cassette  the typical   BASICODE   data storage medium    In the BASICODE format  the recording of programs is analogous to the recording of data  So  when recording programs  the commands are not read and written in the form of single   byte   units    token  parser  token  s   but character by character   A data block begins with the character 02  STX  start of text   and ends with the character 03  ETX  end of text   After ETX  a check byte made up of the previous bytes including STX and ETX by binary addition  XOR   is transmitted  A 0D character  decimal 13  marks the end of a line during transmission  Data files created by programs are able to use all characters as data and must contain no control characters  They are read and written in blocks of 1024 bytes   Each byte is transmitted in the sequence  1 start bit   8 data bits   2 stop bits   The data bits are little endian ordered  The resulting   redundancy  information theory  redundancy   is intended for maximising compatibility with different computers  Bit 7 is always 0  which is especially useful when transmitting   ASCII   characters  because these always have bit 7 set to 0   For the audio signals  square waves  in the form of a 1200   Hertz Hz   wave for a  0  bit and two 2400 Hz waves for a  1  bit are used  resulting in a time of 1 1200 seconds for each bit  A pause longer than 1 1800 seconds between waves marks the beginning of a byte  making the following wave the start bit  After the start bit and before the eight data bits is another pause of at least 1 1800 seconds  A 2400 Hz signal with a length of five seconds marks the beginning of a transmission and is used for synchronization of the reading program  At the end of the transmission  a 2400 Hz signal with a length of one second is sent   The theoretical   data rate   of this format is 1200 bits per second  Considering the transmission of three additional bits per data byte and the pauses before and after the start bit  this results in a usable data rate of 102 bytes per second  and about 6 kilobytes per minute     The BASICODE language standard      BASICODE 2        Commands  functions and operators allowed in BASICODE

3110|BFGS method|In   numerical analysis numerical     optimization  mathematics  optimization    the    Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno        BFGS        method    is a   iterative method method   for solving   nonlinear optimization   problems  which lack constraints    The BFGS method   approximation theory approximates     Newton s method in optimization Newton s method    a class of   hill climbing hill climbing optimization   techniques that seeks a   stationary point   of a  twice continuously differentiable  function  For such problems  a   Kuhn Tucker conditions necessary condition for optimality   is that the   gradient   be zero   Newton s method and the BFGS methods need not converge unless the function has a quadratic   Taylor expansion   near an optimum  These methods use the first and second derivatives     In   quasi Newton methods    the   Hessian matrix   of second   derivative  s need not be evaluated directly  Instead  the Hessian matrix is approximated using rank one updates specified by gradient evaluations  or approximate gradient evaluations     Quasi Newton methods   are a generalization of the   secant method   to find the root of the first derivative  for multidimensional problems   In multi dimensions the secant equation does not specify a unique solution  and quasi Newton methods differ in how they constrain the solution  The BFGS method is one of the most popular members of this class  ref   harvtxt Nocedal Wright 2006    page 24  ref  Also in common use is   L BFGS    which is a limited memory version of BFGS that is particularly suited to problems with very large numbers of variables     Rationale    The search direction    p    sub      k       sub  at stage   k   is given by the solution of the analogue of the Newton equation    math  B k  mathbf p  k      nabla f  mathbf x  k   math   where  math B k  math  is an approximation to the   Hessian matrix   which is updated iteratively at each stage  and   math  nabla f  mathbf x  k   math  is the gradient of the function evaluated at    x    sub    k     sub    A   line search   in the direction    p    sub      k       sub  is then used to find the next point    x    sub    k 1     sub    Instead of requiring the full Hessian matrix at the point    x    sub    k 1     sub  to be computed as   B sub k 1  sub     the approximate Hessian at stage   k   is updated by the addition of two matrices      math B  k 1  B k U k V k      math   Both   U sub k  sub    and   V sub k  sub    are symmetric rank one matrices but have different bases  The symmetric rank one assumption here means that we may write    math C  mathbf a  mathbf b   mathrm T   math   So equivalently    U sub k  sub    and   V sub k  sub    construct a rank two update matrix which is robust against the scale problem often suffered in the   gradient descent   searching    e g     in   Broyden s method      The quasi Newton condition imposed on this update is    math B  k 1    mathbf x   k 1   mathbf x  k      nabla f  mathbf x   k 1     nabla f  mathbf x  k     math     Algorithm    From an initial guess  math  mathbf x  0  math  and an approximate Hessian matrix  math B 0  math  the following steps are repeated until  math x  math  converges to the solution     Obtain a direction  math  mathbf p  k  math  by solving   math B k  mathbf p  k     nabla f  mathbf x  k    math    Perform a   line search   to find an acceptable stepsize  math  alpha k  math  in the direction found in the first step  then update  math  mathbf x   k 1     mathbf x  k    alpha k mathbf p

math  denotes the objective function to be minimized  Convergence can be checked by observing the norm of the gradient   math  left  nabla f  mathbf x  k  right   math   Practically   math B 0  math  can be initialized with  math B 0   I  math   so that the first step will be equivalent to a   gradient descent    but further steps are more and more refined by  math B  k   math   the approximation to the Hessian   The first step of the algorithm is carried out using an approximate inverse of the matrix  math B k  math   which is usually obtained efficiently by applying the   Sherman Morrison formula   to the fifth line of the algorithm  giving      math B  k 1    1    B k   1     frac   mathbf s  k   mathrm T   mathbf y  k  mathbf y  k   mathrm T   B k   1   mathbf y  k   mathbf s  k  mathbf s  k   mathrm T       mathbf s  k   mathrm T    mathbf y  k  2     frac B k   1   mathbf y  k  mathbf s  k   mathrm T      mathbf s  k  mathbf y  k   mathrm T  B k   1    mathbf s  k   mathrm T    mathbf y  k    math   In statistical estimation problems  such as maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference     credible interval  s or   confidence interval  s for the solution can be obtained from the   matrix inverse inverse   of the final Hessian matrix      Implementations    In the   Matlab   Optimization Toolbox  the  http   www mathworks com help toolbox optim ug fminunc html fminunc

unsupervised   data mining   algorithm used to perform   Data clustering hierarchical clustering   over particularly large data sets  An advantage of Birch is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming  multi dimensional metric   data point  s in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources  memory and   time constraint  s   In most cases  Birch only requires a single scan of the database  In addition  Birch is recognized ref   Literatur    Autor   Tian Zhang  Raghu Ramakrishnan  Miron Livny    Titel   An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases     ref  as the   first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle  noise   data points that are not part of the underlying pattern  effectively      Problem with previous methods   Previous clustering algorithms performed less effectively over very large databases and did not adequately consider the case wherein a data set was too large to fit in   Primary storage main memory    As a result  there was a lot of overhead maintaining high clustering quality while minimizing the cost of addition IO  input output  operations  Furthermore  most of Birch s predecessors inspect all data points  or all currently existing clusters  equally for each  clustering decision  and do not perform heuristic weighting based on the distance between these data points     Advantages with BIRCH   It is local in that each clustering decision is made without scanning all data points and currently existing clusters  It exploits the observation that data space is not usually uniformly occupied and not every data point is equally important  It makes full use of available memory to derive the finest possible sub clusters while minimizing I O costs  It is also an incremental method that does not require the whole   data set   in advance     BIRCH Clustering Algorithm   For this first we define the following concepts    Clustering Feature   Given N d dimensional data points in a cluster   math X i  math    math CF  math  vector of the cluster is defined as a triple  math CF    N LS SS   math   where  math LS  math  is the linear sum and  math SS  math  is the square sum of data points   CF tree   A CF tree is a height   Self balancing binary search tree balanced tree   with two parameters    branching factor    math B  math  and threshold  math T  math   Each non leaf node contains at most  math B  math  entries of the form  math  CF i child i   math   where  math child i  math  is a pointer to its  math i  math th   Tree  data structure  child node   and  math CF i  math  is the subcluster represented by this child  A   leaf node   contains at most  math L  math  entries each of the form  math  CF i   math    It also has to two pointers prev and next which are used to chain all leaf nodes together  The tree size is a function of T  The larger the T is  the smaller the tree is  We also require a node to fit in a page of size of p  B and L are determined by P  So P can be varied for   performance tuning    It is a very compact representation of the dataset because each entry in a leaf node is not a single data point but a subcluster   In the algorithm in the first step it scans all data and builds an initial memory CF tree using the given amount of memory  In the second step it scans all the leaf entries in the initial CF tree to rebuild a smaller CF tree  while removing outliers and grouping crowded subclusters into larger ones  In step three we use an existing clustering algorithm to cluster all leaf entries  Here an agglomerative hierarchial clustering algorithm is applied directly to the subclusters represented by their CF vectors  It also provides the flexibiltiy of allowing the user to specify either the desired number of clusters or the desired diameter threshold for clusters  After this step we obtain a set of clusters that captures major distribution pattern in the data  However there might exist minor and localized inaccuracies which can be handled by an optional step 4  In step 4 we use the centroids of the clusters produced in step as seeds and redistribute the data points to its closest sees to obtain a new set of clusters  Step 4 also provides us with an option of discarding outliers  That is a point which is too far from its closest seed can be treated as an outlier     Awards   It has received  ref   Literatur    url   http   www sigmod org sigmod awards citations 2006 sigmod test of time award 1    Titel   http   www sigmod org sigmod

Mellon University   by   W  A  Wulf      D  B  Russell    and   A  N  Habermann   around 1970  It was perhaps the best known systems programming language right up until   C  programming language  C   made its debut a few years later  Since then  C took off and BLISS faded into obscurity  When C was in its infancy  a few projects within   Bell Labs   were debating the merits of BLISS vs  C   BLISS is a typeless block structured language based on expressions rather than statements  and includes constructs for   exception handling      coroutine  s  and   Macro  computer science  macros    It does not include a   GOTO goto   statement   The name is variously said to be short for  Basic Language for Implementation of System Software  or  System Software Implementation Language  Backwards   It was sometimes called  Bill s Language for Implementing System Software   after Bill Wulf    The original Carnegie Mellon   compiler   was notable for its extensive use of   compiler optimization optimization  s  and formed the basis of the classic book     The Design of an Optimizing Compiler         Digital Equipment Corporation DEC   developed and maintained BLISS compilers for the   PDP 10      PDP 11      DEC Alpha      DEC PRISM      IA 32 Intel IA 32      IA 64 Intel IA 64    and   VAX    and used it heavily in house into the 1980s  most of the utility programs for the   Virtual Memory System VMS     operating system   were written in BLISS 32      Language description      Cquote2 BLISS has many of the features of other modern high level languages  It has block structure  an automatic stack  and mechanisms for defining and calling recursive routines   provides a variety of predefined data structures and    facilities for testing and iteration     On the other hand  BLISS omits certain features of other high level languages  It does not have built in facilities for input output  because a system software project usually develops its own input output or builds on basic monitor I O or screen management services    it permits access to machine specific features  because system software often requires this  BLISS has characteristics that are unusual among high level languages  A name    is uniformly interpreted as the address of that segment rather than the value of the segment    Also  BLISS is an   expression language   rather than a   statement language    This means that every construct of the language that is not a declaration is an expression  Expressions produce a value as well as possibly causing an action such as modification of storage  transfer of control  or execution of a program loop  For example  the counterpart of an assignment   statement   in BLISS is  strictly speaking  an expression that itself has a value  The value of an expression can be either used or discarded in BLISS    Finally  BLISS includes a macro facility that provides a level of capability usually found only in macro assemblers   http   63 249 85 132 langs bliss bliss pdf Bliss Language Manual    Digital Equipment Corporation    1987     The BLISS language has the following characteristics     All    constants    are full word for the machine being used  e g  on a 16 bit machine such as the   PDP 11    a constant is 16 bits  on a   VAX   computer  constants are 32 bits  and on a   PDP 10    a constant is 36 bits     A    reference to a variable    is always to the address of that variable   For example  the instruction  code Z 8  code  refers to adding 8 to the   address   of Z  not to its   value     If one needs to add 8 to the   value   of Z  one must prefix the variable with a period  so one would type  code  Z 8  code  to perform this function  which adds 8 to the   contents   of Z        Assignment    is done with the standard  code    code  symbol  e g   code Z 8  code   ndash  which says to create a full word constant containing 8  and store it in the location whose address corresponds to that of Z   So  you can do something like  code Z 12 14  code   or  alternatively  code 12 Z 14  code   which places the constant 14 into the address which is 12 words more than the address of Z    This is considered bad practice           Block statements    are similar to those of   ALGOL    a block is started with a  code BEGIN  code  statement and terminated with  code END  code    As with ALGOL  statements are terminated with the semicolon        When a value is computed  it is saved until the next statement terminator  ndash  which means that a value can be computed  assigned to a variable  and carried forward to the next statement  if desired   Alternatively  an open parenthesis may be used to begin a block  with the close parenthesis used to close the block   When parentheses are included in an expression  the standard   precedence   rules are used  in which parenthesized expressions are computed first         Conditional execution    uses the  code IF  code  expression  which tests a true false condition  performs alternative actions  and returns a result        Comparison    uses keywords such as  code EQL  code  for equality  as opposed to   operator overloading overloading   the   symbol for the same purpose    code GTR  code  for Greater Than  and  code NEQ  code  for not equal  For example  the following code will assign the absolute value of Z to the address indicated by Q      code Q    IF  Z GTR 0 THEN  Z ELSE   Z    code        Identifiers     variables and constants  must be declared before use  typically using the  code OWN  code  keyword  Declaring a variable normally causes the compiler to allocate space for it  when necessary  a variable may be assigned a fixed machine address via the  code BIND  code  declaration  This feature is primarily used for accessing either machine registers or certain special addresses        Subroutines    in the language are called   routines    and are declared with the keyword  code ROUTINE  code         Macros     which allow for text substitution  are declared with the keyword  code MACRO  code      The language supports    arrays     which are referred to as   structures    and declared with the keyword  code VECTOR  code      The language supports some    high level programming constructs    such as        Alternative execution paths    via the  code CASE  code  expression      Looping    through use of the  code INCR  code  expression  which is similar to ALGOL s FOR statement   Built in    string functions      Certain automatic    data conversions     number to string  etc      Source example   The following

ref  They scanned the   BLOCKS database   for very conserved regions of protein families  that do not have gaps in the sequence alignment  and then counted the relative frequencies of   amino acids   and their substitution probabilities  Then  they calculated a   odds ratio log odds   score for each of the 210 possible substitutions of the 20 standard amino acids  All BLOSUM matrices are based on observed alignments  they are not extrapolated from comparisons of closely related proteins like the   Point accepted mutation PAM Matrices     Several sets of BLOSUM matrices exist using different alignment databases  named with numbers  BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences  while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences  For example  BLOSUM80 is used for less divergent alignments  and BLOSUM45 is used for more divergent alignments  The matrices were created by merging  clustering  all sequences that were more similar than a given percentage into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences  that were all more divergent than the given percentage value  only  thus reducing the contribution of closely related sequences  The percentage used was appended to the name  giving BLOSUM80 for example where sequences that were more than 80  identical were clustered    Scores within a BLOSUM are log odds scores that measure  in an alignment  the logarithm for the ratio of the likelihood of two amino acids appearing with a biological sense and the likelihood of the same amino acids appearing by

3164|BQP|  Image BQP complexity class diagram svg thumb The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces ref Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang  2000     Quantum Computation and Quantum Information    Cambridge  Cambridge University Press  ISBN 0 521 63503 9   ref    In   computational complexity theory      BQP     bounded error quantum polynomial time  is the class of   decision problems   solvable by a   quantum computer   in   polynomial time    with an error probability of at most 1 3 for all instances  It is the quantum analogue of the complexity class   BPP     In other words  there is an   algorithm   for a quantum computer  a   quantum algorithm    that solves the decision problem with   high   probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time  On any given run of the algorithm  it has a probability of at most 1 3 that it will give the wrong answer   Similarly to other  bounded error  probabilistic classes the choice of 1 3 in the definition is arbitrary  We can run the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1  using the   Chernoff bound    Detailed analysis shows that the complexity class is unchanged by allowing error as high as 1 2     n   sup    c    sup  on the one hand  or requiring error as small as 2 sup    n sup c  sup     sup  on the other hand  where   c   is any positive constant  and   n   is the length of input     Definition      BQP    can also be viewed as a bounded error uniform family of   quantum circuit  s  A language   L   is in    BQP    if and only if there exists a   Circuit complexity Polynomial time uniform polynomial time uniform   family of quantum circuits  math   Q n n  in  mathbb N     math   such that    For all  math n  in

factoring an   n   bit integer using just over 2  n   qubits    Shor s algorithm      Usually  computation on a quantum computer ends with a   Measurement in quantum mechanics measurement    This leads to a   Wavefunction collapse collapse   of quantum state to one of the   Quantum state basis states    It can be said that the quantum state is measured to be in the correct state with high probability   Quantum computers have gained widespread interest because some problems of practical interest are known to be in    BQP     but suspected to be outside    P     Some prominent examples

3238|Backscatter  e mail |   Backscatter     also known as    outscatter        misdirected bounces        blowback    or    collateral spam     is incorrect automated   bounce message  s sent by mail servers  typically as a side effect of incoming   e mail spam spam      Recipients of such messages see them as a form of   unsolicited bulk e mail   or   E mail spam spam   since they were not solicited by the recipients  are substantially similar to each other and are delivered in bulk quantities  Systems that generate e mail backscatter can end up being listed on various   DNSBL  s and be in violation of   internet service provider  s    Terms of Service     Backscatter occurs because   computer worm worms   and   e mail spam spam messages   often forge their   envelope sender sender   address  and mailservers configured by naive administrators send a   bounce message   to this address   Measures to reduce the problem include avoiding the need for   bounce message   by doing most rejections at the initial   SMTP   connection stage  and sending bounce messages only to addresses which can be reliably judged to have not been forged     Cause   Authors of spam and viruses wish to make their messages appear to originate from a legitimate source to fool recipients into opening the message so they often use   web crawler web crawling software   to scan   usenet   postings    message board  s  and web pages for legitimate  e mail addresses   Due to the design of   SMTP   mail  recipient mail servers receiving these forged messages have no simple standard way to determine the authenticity of the sender  If they accept the email during the connection phases then  after further checking refuse it   for example because they believe it to be   spam  electronic  spam   they will use the  potentially forged  sender s address to attempt a good faith effort to report the problem to the apparent sender   Mail servers can handle undeliverable messages in three fundamentally different ways        Reject     A receiving server can reject the incoming e mail during the connection stage   while the sending server is still connected    If a message is rejected at connect time with a 5xx error code then the   sending   server can report the problem to the real sender cleanly        Drop     A receiving server can initially accept the full message  but then determine that it is spam  and   quarantine   it   delivering to  Junk  or  Spam  folders from where it will eventually be deleted automatically  This is common behaviour  even though RFC 5321 says        silent dropping of messages should be considered only in those cases where there is very high confidence that the messages are seriously fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate             Bounce     A receiving server can initially accept the full message  but then determine that it is spam or to a non existent recipient  and generate a   bounce message   back to the supposed sender indicating that message delivery failed   Backscatter occurs when the  bounce  method is used  and the sender information on the incoming e mail was that of an unrelated third party     Reducing the problem    Every step to control    computer worm worms   and   e mail spam spam messages   helps reduce backscatter  but there are also several other common approaches      Preventing email address collection    It is common to attempt to obscure email addresses in a manner that is not easily machine readable  Several methods are available  such as simply not using a standard text format    john  at  example com    or using a   bitmap image   of the address rather than raw text  More complex address obscuration methods are available  such as encoding the addresses using a   substitution cipher    embedded as program code within a tiny   javascript   or   Adobe Flash   program for each address  which when clicked  opens a temporary window and sends the decoded   mailto    address to the local e mail client  but all such obscuration methods can potentially  be attacked by spammers in the same manner as   CAPTCHA  s      Connection stage rejection    During the initial   SMTP   connection mailservers can do a range of checks  and often reject email with a 5xx error code   while the sending server is still connected    Rejecting a message at the connection stage in this way will usually cause the   sending     Mail transfer agent MTA   to generate a local   bounce message   or Non Delivery Notification  NDN  to a local  authenticated user  ref Alternatively  if the MTA is relaying the message  it should only send such an NDN to a plausible  span class  explain  title  envelope sender  originator  span    as indicated in the reverse path   J  Klensin   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol   IETF

3239|Backtracking|   Backtracking    is a general   algorithm   for finding all  or some  solutions to some computational problem  that incrementally builds  candidates to the solutions  and abandons each partial candidate   c     backtracks   as soon as it determines that   c   cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution  ref   cite book   title     The Art of Computer Programming     author

CIS 680  DATA STRUCTURES  Chapter 19  Backtracking Algorithms   year 1999   author Gurari  Eitan    ref   The classic textbook example of the use of backtracking is the   eight queens puzzle    that asks for all arrangements of eight queens on a standard   chess chessboard   so that no queen attacks any other   In the common backtracking approach  the partial candidates are arrangements of   k   queens in the first   k   rows of the board  all in different rows and columns   Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be abandoned  since it cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution    Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a  partial candidate solution  and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution   It is useless  for example  for locating a given value in an unordered table   When it is applicable  however  backtracking is often much faster than    brute force search brute force enumeration   of all complete candidates  since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test   Backtracking is an important tool for solving   constraint satisfaction problem  s  such as   crosswords      verbal arithmetic      Algorithmics of sudoku Sudoku    and many other puzzles   It is often the most convenient  if not the most efficient   technique for   parsing    for the   knapsack problem   and other   combinatorial optimization   problems   It is also the basis of the so called   logic programming   languages such as    Icon programming language Icon      Planner programming language Planner   and   Prolog    Backtracking is also utilized in the  diff  difference engine for the   MediaWiki   software   Backtracking depends on user given    procedural parameter black box procedure  s  that define the problem to be solved  the nature of the partial candidates  and how they are extended into complete candidates   It is therefore a   metaheuristic   rather than a specific algorithm     although  unlike many other meta heuristics  it is guaranteed to find all solutions to a finite problem in a bounded amount of time   The term  backtrack  was coined by American mathematician   Derrick Henry Lehmer D  H  Lehmer   in the 1950s  ref   cite book    title  Handbook of Constraint Programming    url  http   books

The backtracking algorithm enumerates a set of   partial candidates   that  in principle  could be   completed   in various ways to give all the possible solutions to the given problem  The completion is done incrementally  by a sequence of   candidate extension steps       Conceptually  the partial candidates are the nodes of a   tree structure    the   potential search tree    Each partial candidate is the parent of the candidates that differ from it by a single extension step   the leaves of the tree are the partial candidates that cannot be extended any further     The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree   recursion  computer science  recursively    from the root down  in   depth first search depth first order     At each node   c    the algorithm checks whether   c   can be completed to a valid solution   If it cannot  the whole sub tree rooted at   c   is skipped    pruned      Otherwise  the algorithm  1  checks whether   c   itself is a valid solution  and if so reports it to the user  and  2  recursively enumerates all sub trees  of   c     The two tests and the children of each node are defined by user given procedures   Therefore  the   actual search tree   that is traversed by the algorithm is only a part of the potential tree   The total cost of the algorithm is basically the number of nodes of the actual tree times the cost of obtaining and processing each node   This fact should be considered when choosing the potential search tree and implementing the pruning test       Pseudocode     In order to apply backtracking to a specific class of problems  one must provide the data   P   for the particular instance of the problem that is to be solved  and  six   procedural parameter  s    root      reject      accept      first      next    and   output    These procedures should take the instance data   P   as a parameter and should do the following         root  P       return the partial candidate at the root of the search tree      reject     P     c      return   true   only if the partial candidate   c   is not worth completing      accept     P     c     return   true   if   c   is a solution of   P    and   false   otherwise      first     P     c     generate the first extension of candidate   c        next     P     s     generate the next alternative extension of a candidate  after the extension   s        output     P     c      use the solution   c   of   P    as appropriate to the application   The backtracking algorithm reduces then to the call    bt     root     P      where   bt   is the following recursive procedure        procedure      bt     c           if      reject     P     c       then       return           if      accept     P     c       then      output     P     c          s       first     P     c           while      s          do            bt     s            s       next     P     s        Usage considerations     The   reject   procedure should be a   boolean valued function   that returns   true   only if it is certain that no possible extension of   c   is a valid solution for   P     If the procedure cannot reach a definite conclusion  it should return   false    An incorrect   true   result may  cause the   bt   procedure to miss some valid solutions   The procedure may assume that   reject     P     t    returned   false   for every ancestor   t   of   c   in the search tree   On the other hand  the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm depends on   reject   returning   true   for candidates that are as close to the root as possible   If   reject   always returns   false    the algorithm will still find all solutions  but it will be equivalent to a brute force search   The   accept   procedure should return   true   if   c   is a complete and valid solution for the problem instance   P    and   false   otherwise   It may assume that the partial candidate   c   and all its ancestors in the tree have passed the   reject   test   Note that the general pseudo code above does not assume that the valid solutions are always leaves of the potential search tree   In other words  it admits the possibility that a valid solution for   P   can be further extended to yield other valid solutions    The   first   and   next   procedures are used by the backtracking algorithm to enumerate the children of a node   c   of the tree  that is  the candidates that differ from   c   by a single  extension step   The call   first     P     c    should yield the first child of   c    in some order  and the call   next     P     s    should return the next sibling of node   s    in that order   Both functions should return a distinctive  null  candidate  denoted here by      if the requested child does not exist    Together  the   root      first    and   next   functions define the set of partial candidates and the potential search tree   They should be chosen so that every  solution of   P   occurs somewhere in the tree  and no partial candidate occurs more than once   Moreover  they should admit an efficient and effective   reject   predicate      Early stopping variants    The pseudo code above will call   output   for every candidate that is a solution to the given instance   P    The algorithm is easily modified to stop after finding the first solution  or a specified number of solutions  or after testing a specified number of partial candidates  or after spending a given amount of   central processing unit CPU   time      Examples        Constraint satisfaction    The general   constraint satisfaction problem   consists in finding a list of integers   x        x   1    x   2        x     n      each in some range  1  2       m     that satisfies some arbitrary constraint  boolean function    F     For this class of problems  the instance data   P   would be the integers   m   and   n    and the predicate   F    In a typical  backtracking solution to this problem  one could define a partial candidate as a list of integers   c         c   1    c   2       c   k    for any   k   between 0 and   n     that are to be assigned to the first   k   variables   x   1    x   2        x     k       The root candidate would then be the empty list      The   first   and   next   procedures would then be      function      first     P     c          k        length      c           if      k       n            then       return               else       return       c   1     c   2        c     k     1          function      next     P     s          k        length      s           if      s     k        m            then       return               else       return       s   1     s   2        s     k   1   1     s     k     Here     length      c     is the number of elements in the list   c     The call   reject     P     c    should return   true   if the constraint   F   cannot be satisfied by any list of   n   integers that begins with the   k   elements of   c     For backtracking to be effective   there must be a way to detect this situation  at least for some candidates   c     without enumerating all those   m   sup   n     k    sup    n   tuples   For example  if   F   is the   conjunction   of several boolean predicates    F       F   1   math  wedge  math    F   2   math  wedge  math   math  cdots  math   math  wedge  math    F   p   and each   F   i  depends only on a small subset of the variables   x   1        x     n     then the   reject   procedure could simply check the terms   F   i  that depend only on variables   x   1        x     k     and return   true  if any of those terms returns   false     In fact    reject   needs only check those terms that do depend on   x     k     since the terms that depend only on   x   1        x     k   1  will have been tested further up in the search tree   Assuming that   reject   is implemented as above  then   accept     P     c    needs only check whether   c   is complete  that is  whether it has   n   elements   It is generally better to order the list of variables so that it begins with the most critical ones  i e  the ones with fewest value options  or which have a greater impact on subsequent choices    One could also allow the   next   function to choose which variable should be assigned when extending a partial candidate   based on the values of the variables already assigned by it   Further improvements can be obtained by the technique of   constraint propagation     In addition to retaining minimal recovery values used in backing up  backtracking implementations commonly keep a   variable trail    to record value change history   An efficient implementation will avoid creating a variable trail entry between two successive changes when there is no choice point  as the backtracking will erase all of the changes as a single operation   An alternative to the variable trail is to keep a   timestamp   of when the last change was made to the variable  The timestamp is compared to the timestamp of a choice point  If the choice point has an associated time later than that of the variable  it is unnecessary to revert the variable when the choice point is backtracked  as it was changed before the choice point occurred     See also      Ariadne s thread  logic       Backjumping      Recursion  computer science       Notes     Reflist      References     Refbegin

speakers never say or write  she backups  or  he backuped  and instead always say and write the verb in two parts  in other words   she  backs up  and   he  backed up   Surprisingly  many even

configurations such as a   computer cluster      active directory   servers  or a   database server    by restoring only data from a backup      Since a backup system contains at least one copy of all data worth saving  the   computer data storage data storage   requirements are considerable  Organizing this storage space and managing the backup process is a complicated undertaking  A data repository model can be used to provide structure to the storage  In the modern era of computing there are many different types of   data storage device  s that are useful for making backups  There are also many different ways in which these devices can be arranged to provide geographic redundancy    data security    and portability   Before data is sent to its storage location  it is selected  extracted  and manipulated  Many different techniques have been developed to optimize the backup procedure  These include optimizations for dealing with open files and live data sources as well as compression  encryption  and de duplication  among others  Many organizations and individuals try to have confidence that the process is working as expected and work to define measurements and validation techniques  It is also important to recognize the limitations and human factors involved in any backup scheme     Storage  the base of a backup system      Data repository models    Any backup strategy starts with a concept of a data repository  The backup data needs to be stored somehow and probably should be organized to a degree  It can be as simple as a sheet of paper with a list of all backup tapes and the dates they were written or a more sophisticated setup with a computerized index  catalog  or relational database  Different repository models have different advantages  This is closely related to choosing a   backup rotation scheme          Unstructured      An unstructured repository may simply be a stack of floppy disks or CD R DVD R media with minimal information about what was backed up and when  This is the easiest to implement  but probably the least likely to achieve a high level of recoverability       Full     Incremental backup incrementals        A full   incremental repository aims to make it more feasible to store several copies of the source data  At first  a   full   backup  of all files  is made  After that  any number of   incremental   backups can be made   There are many different types of incremental backups  but they all attempt to only back up a small amount of data  when compared to the size of a full backup   An incremental backup copies everything that has changed since the last backup  full  differential or incremental   Restoring a whole system to a certain point in time would require locating the last full backup taken previous to that time and all the incremental backups that cover the period of time between the full backup and the particular point in time to which the system is supposed to be restored  ref  http   www tech faq com incremental backup shtml Incremental Backup   Retrieved on 10 March 2006   ref  The scope of an incremental backup is typically defined as the period of time between other full or incremental backups   Different implementations of backup systems frequently use specialized or conflicting definitions of these terms       Differential backup      A differential backup copies files that have been created or changed since the last full backup  It does not mark files as having been backed up  in other words  the archive attribute is not cleared   If you are performing a combination of full and differential backups  restoring files and folders requires that you have the last full as well as the last differential backup       Reverse delta      A reverse delta system stores the differences between current versions of a system and previous versions   A reverse delta backup will start with a normal full backup   After the full backup is performed  the system will periodically synchronize the full backup with the live copy  while storing the data necessary to reconstruct older versions  This can either be done using   hard links    or using binary   diffs    This system works particularly well for large  slowly changing  data sets   Examples of programs that use this method are   rdiff backup   and   Time Machine  Apple software  Time Machine          Continuous data protection        Instead of scheduling periodic backups  the system immediately logs every change on the host system  This is generally done by saving byte or block level differences rather than file level differences  ref  http   www emc com analyst pdf Ovum200510 pdf Continuous Protection white paper    1 October 2005   Retrieved on 10 March 2007   ref  It differs from simple   disk mirroring   in that it enables a roll back of the log and thus restoration of old image of data       Full system backup      This type of backup is designed to allow an entire PC to be recovered to  bare metal  without any installation of operating system  application software and data   Most users understand that a backup will prevent  data  from being lost   The expense in a full system recovery is in the hours that it takes for a technician to rebuild a machine to the point of restoring the last data backup  So  a full system backup makes a complete   system image image   of the computer so that if needed  it can be copied back to the PC  usually using some type of bespoke software such as   Ghost  software  Ghost    and the user can carry on from that point      Storage media    Regardless of the repository model that is used  the data has to be stored on some data storage medium somewhere       Magnetic tape data storage Magnetic tape     Magnetic tape has long been the most commonly used medium for bulk data storage  backup  archiving  and interchange   Tape has typically had an order of magnitude better capacity price ratio when compared to hard disk  but recently the ratios for tape and hard disk have become a lot closer  ref  http   www storagesearch com engenio art2 html  Disk to Disk Backup versus Tape   War or Truce    9 December 2004   Retrieved

excellent portability and ease of use      Remote backup service     As   broadband internet access   becomes more widespread  remote backup services are gaining in popularity   Backing up via the internet to a remote location can protect against some worst case scenarios such as fires  floods  or earthquakes which would destroy any backups in the immediate vicinity along with everything else   There are  however  a number of drawbacks to remote backup services   First  Internet connections are usually slower than local data storage devices  Residential broadband is especially problematic as routine backups must use an upstream link that s usually much slower than the downstream link used only occasionally to retrieve a file from backup  This tends to limit the use of such services to relatively small amounts of high value data  Secondly  users must trust a third party service provider to maintain the privacy and integrity of their data  although confidentiality can be assured by encrypting the data before transmission to the backup service with a   key  cryptography  encryption key   known only to the user  Ultimately the backup service must itself use one of the above methods so this could be seen as a more complex way of doing traditional backups      Managing the data repository    Regardless of the data repository model or data storage media used for backups  a balance needs to be struck between accessibility  security and cost   These media management methods are not mutually exclusive and are frequently combined to meet the needs of the situation   Using on line disks for staging data before it is sent to a near line   tape library   is a common example       Online On line     On line backup storage is typically the most accessible type of data storage  which can begin restore in milliseconds time  A good example would be an internal hard disk or a   disk array    maybe connected to   Storage area network SAN     This type of storage is very convenient and speedy  but is relatively expensive  On line storage is quite vulnerable to being deleted or overwritten  either by accident  by intentional malevolent action  or in the wake of a data deleting   Computer virus virus   payload      Nearline storage Near line     Near line storage is typically less accessible and less expensive than on line storage  but still useful for backup data storage  A good example would be a   tape library   with  restore times ranging from seconds to a few minutes  A mechanical device is usually involved in moving media units from storage into a drive where the data can be read or written   Generally it has safety properties similar to on line storage      Off line storage Off line     Off line storage requires some direct human action in order to make access to the storage media physically possible   This action is typically inserting a tape into a tape drive or plugging in a cable that allows a device to be accessed   Because the data is not accessible via any computer except during limited periods in which it is written or read back  it is largely immune to a whole class of on line backup failure modes   Access time will vary depending on whether the media is on site or off site      Off site data protection    To protect against a disaster or other site specific problem  many people choose to send backup media to an off site vault  The vault can be as simple as a system administrator s home office or as sophisticated as a disaster hardened  temperature controlled  high security bunker that has facilities for backup media storage  Importantly a data replica   can   be off site but also   on line    e g   an off site   RAID   mirror    Such a replica has fairly limited value as a backup  and should not be confused with an off line backup      Backup site   or disaster recovery center  DR center   In the event of a disaster  the data on backup media will not be sufficient to recover  Computer systems onto which the data can be restored and properly configured networks are necessary too   Some organizations have their own data recovery centers that are equipped for this scenario  Other organizations contract this out to a third party recovery center  Because a DR site is itself a huge investment  backing up is very rarely considered the preferred method of moving data to a DR site  A more typical way would be remote   disk mirroring    which keeps the DR data as up to date as possible      Selection and extraction of data    A successful backup job starts with selecting and extracting coherent units of data   Most data on modern computer systems is stored in discrete units  known as   Computer file file  s   These files are organized into   filesystem  s   Files that are actively being updated can be thought of as  live  and present a challenge to back up   It is also useful to save metadata that describes the computer or the filesystem being backed up   Deciding what to back up at any given time is a harder process than it seems  By backing up too much redundant data  the data repository will fill up too quickly  Backing up an insufficient amount of data can eventually lead to the loss of critical information       Files         File copying Copying files     Making copies of files is the simplest and most common way to perform a backup  A means to perform this basic function is included in all backup software and all operating systems     Partial file copying   Instead of copying whole files  one can limit the backup to only the blocks or bytes within a file that have changed in a given period of time  This technique can use substantially less storage space on the backup medium  but requires a high level of sophistication to reconstruct files in a restore situation   Some implementations require integration with the source filesystem   When backing up over a network  the   rsync   utility automatically transmits a minimum set of changes to bring an earlier version of a file at the destination up to date with the current version at the source  Rsync can dramatically reduce the network traffic needed to maintain a remote mirror of a large set of files undergoing small  frequent changes       Filesystems       Filesystem dump   Instead of copying files within a filesystem  a copy of the whole filesystem itself can be made  This is also known as a   raw partition backup   and is related to   disk image disk imaging    The process usually involves unmounting the filesystem and running a program like   dd  Unix     Because the disk is read sequentially and with large buffers  this type of backup can be much faster than reading every file normally  especially when the filesystem contains many small files  is highly fragmented  or is nearly full  But because this method also reads the free disk blocks that contain no useful data  this method can also be slower than conventional reading  especially when the filesystem is nearly empty  Some filesystems  such as   XFS    provide a  dump  utility that reads the disk sequentially for high performance while skipping unused sections  The corresponding restore utility can selectively restore individual files or the entire volume at the operator s choice     Identification of changes   Some filesystems have an archive bit for each file that says it was recently changed  Some backup software looks at the date of the file and compares it with the last backup to determine whether the file was changed       Versioning file system     A versioning filesystem keeps track of all changes to a file and makes those changes accessible to the user  Generally this gives access to any previous version  all the way back to the file s creation time  An example of this is the Wayback versioning filesystem

in use while it is being backed up  the possibility of files being open for reading or writing is real   If a file is open  the contents on disk may not correctly represent what the owner of the file intends   This is especially true for database files of all kinds   The term   fuzzy backup   can be used to describe a backup of live data that looks like it ran correctly  but does not represent the state of the data at any single point in time   This is because the data being backed up changed in the period of time between when the backup started and when it finished   For databases in

File locking   is useful for regulating access to open files    When attempting to understand the logistics of backing up open files  one must consider that the backup process could take several minutes to back up a large file such as a database   In order to back up a file that is in use  it is vital that the entire backup represent a single moment snapshot of the file  rather than a simple copy of a read through   This represents a challenge when backing up a file that is constantly changing   Either the database file must be locked to prevent changes  or a method must be implemented to ensure that the original snapshot is preserved long enough to be copied  all while changes are being preserved   Backing up a file while it is being changed  in a manner that causes the first part of the backup to represent data   before   changes occur to be combined with later parts of the backup   after   the change results in a corrupted file that is unusable  as most large files contain internal references between their various parts that must remain consistent throughout the file     Cold database backup   During a cold backup  the database is closed or locked and not available to users   The datafiles do not change during the backup process so the database is in a consistent state when it is returned to normal operation  ref  http   www wisc edu drmt oratips sess003 html coldbackup Oracle Tips   10 December 1997   Retrieved on 10 March 2007   ref     Hot database backup   Some database management systems offer a means to generate a backup image of the database while it is online and usable   hot     This usually includes an inconsistent image of the data files plus a log of changes made while the procedure is running  Upon a restore  the changes in the log files are reapplied to bring the database in sync  ref  http   www wisc edu drmt oratips sess003 html Hotbackup Oracle Tips   10 December 1997   Retrieved on 10 March 2007   ref       Metadata     Not all information stored on the computer is stored in files  Accurately recovering a complete system from scratch requires keeping track of this non file data too    System description   System specifications are needed to procure an exact replacement after a disaster      Boot sector     The boot sector can sometimes be recreated more easily than saving it  Still  it usually isn t a normal file and the system won t boot without it      Disk partitioning Partition   layout   The layout of the original disk  as well as partition tables and filesystem settings  is needed to properly recreate the original system    File   metadata     Each file s permissions  owner  group  ACLs  and any other metadata need to be backed up for a restore to properly recreate the original environment    System metadata   Different operating systems have different ways of storing configuration information     Microsoft Windows   keeps a   Windows Registry registry   of system information that is more difficult to restore than a typical file      Manipulation of data and dataset optimization    It is frequently useful or required to manipulate the data being backed up to optimize the backup process  These manipulations can provide many benefits including improved backup speed  restore speed  data security  media usage and or reduced bandwidth requirements      Data compression Compression     Various schemes can be employed to shrink the size of the source data to be stored so that it uses less storage space  Compression is frequently a built in feature of tape drive hardware      Data deduplication De duplication     When multiple similar systems are backed up to the same destination storage device  there exists the potential for much redundancy within the backed up data  For example  if 20 Windows workstations were backed up to the same data repository  they might share a common set of system files   The data repository only needs to store one copy of those files to be able to restore any one of those workstations   This technique can be applied at the file level or even on raw blocks of data  potentially resulting in a massive reduction in required storage space   Deduplication can occur on a server before any data moves to backup media  sometimes referred to as source client side deduplication   This approach also reduces bandwidth required to send backup data to its target media  The process can also occur at the target storage device  sometimes referred to as inline or back end deduplication     Replication  computer science  Duplication     Sometimes backup jobs are duplicated to a second set of storage media  This can be done to rearrange the backup images to optimize restore speed or to have a second copy at a different location or on a different storage medium      Encryption     High capacity removable storage media such as backup tapes present a data security risk if they are lost or stolen  ref  http   www securityfocus com news 11048 Backups tapes a backdoor for identity thieves   28 April 2004   Retrieved on 10 March 2007   ref  Encrypting the data on these media can mitigate this problem  but presents new problems  Encryption is a CPU intensive process that can slow down backup speeds  and the security of the encrypted backups is only as effective as the security of the key management policy      Multiplexing     When there are many more computers to be backed up than there are destination storage devices  the ability to use a single storage device with several simultaneous backups can be useful    Refactoring   The process of rearranging the backup sets in a data repository is known as refactoring   For example  if a backup system uses a single tape each day to store the incremental backups for all the protected computers  restoring one of the computers could potentially require many tapes   Refactoring could be used to consolidate all the backups for a single computer onto a single tape   This is especially useful for backup systems that do   incrementals forever   style backups      Disk staging Staging     Sometimes backup jobs are copied to a staging disk before being copied to tape   This process is sometimes referred to as D2D2T  an acronym for Disk to Disk to Tape   This can be useful if there is a problem matching the speed of the final destination device with the source device as is frequently faced in network based backup systems   It can also serve as a centralized location for applying other data manipulation techniques     Managing the backup process   It is important to understand that backing up is a process  As long as new data is being created and changes are being made  backups will need to be updated   Individuals and organizations with anything from one computer to thousands  or even millions  of computer systems all have requirements for protecting data  While the scale is different  the objectives and limitations are essentially the same  Likewise  those who perform backups need to know to what extent they were successful  regardless of scale      Objectives        Recovery point objective    RPO    The point in time that the restarted infrastructure will reflect  Essentially  this is the roll back that will be experienced as a result of the recovery  The most desirable RPO would be the point just prior to the data loss event  Making a more recent recovery point achievable requires increasing the frequency of   file synchronization synchronization   between the source data and the backup repository  ref  http   www

ref      Data security     In addition to preserving access to data for its owners  data must be restricted from unauthorized access   Backups must be performed in a manner that does not compromise the original owner s undertaking  This can be achieved with data encryption and proper media handling policies      Limitations    An effective backup scheme will take into consideration the limitations of the situation    Backup window   The period of time when backups are permitted to run on a system is called the backup window  This is typically the time when the system sees the least usage and the backup process will have the least amount of interference with normal operations  The backup window is usually planned with users  convenience in mind  If a backup extends past the defined backup window  a decision is made whether it is more beneficial to abort the backup or to lengthen the backup window    Performance impact   All backup schemes have some performance impact on the system being backed up  For example  for the period of time that a computer system is being backed up  the hard drive is busy reading files for the purpose of backing up  and its full bandwidth is no longer available for other tasks  Such impacts should be analyzed    Costs of hardware  software  labor   All types of storage media have a finite capacity with a real cost  Matching the correct amount of storage capacity  over time  with the backup needs is an important part of the design of a backup scheme  Any backup scheme has some labor requirement  but complicated schemes have considerably higher labor requirements  The cost of commercial backup software can also be considerable    Network bandwidth   Distributed backup systems can be affected by limited network bandwidth      Implementation    Meeting the defined objectives in the face of the above limitations can be a difficult task  The tools and concepts below can make that task more achievable    Scheduling   Using a   job scheduler   can greatly improve the reliability and consistency of backups by removing part of the human element  Many backup software packages include this functionality    Authentication   Over the course of regular operations  the user accounts and or system agents that perform the backups need to be authenticated at some level  The power to copy all data off of or onto a system requires unrestricted access  Using an authentication mechanism is a good way to prevent the backup scheme from being used for unauthorized activity      Chain of trust     Removable   storage media   are physical items and must only be handled by trusted individuals   Establishing a chain of trusted individuals  and vendors  is critical to defining the security of the data      Measuring the process    To ensure that the backup scheme is working as expected  the process needs to include monitoring key factors and maintaining historical data       Backup validation      also known as  backup success validation   The process by which owners of data can get information about how their data was backed up  This same process is also used to prove compliance to regulatory bodies outside of the organization  for example  an insurance company might be required under   HIPAA   to show  proof  that their patient data are meeting records retention requirements  ref  http   www hipaadvisory com regs recordretention htm HIPAA Advisory   Retrieved on 10 March 2007   ref  Disaster  data complexity  data value and increasing dependence upon ever growing volumes of data all contribute to the anxiety around and dependence upon successful backups to ensure   business continuity    For that reason  many organizations rely on third party or  independent  solutions to test  validate  and optimize their backup operations  backup reporting     Reporting   In larger configurations  reports are useful for monitoring media usage  device status  errors  vault coordination and other information about the backup process    Logging   In addition to the history of computer generated reports  activity and change logs are useful for monitoring backup system events    Validation    Many backup programs make use of   checksum  s or   hash function hash  es to validate that the data was accurately copied  These offer several advantages  First  they allow data integrity to be verified without reference to the original file  if the file as stored on the backup medium has the same checksum as the saved value  then it is very probably correct   Second  some backup programs can use checksums to avoid making redundant copies of files  to improve backup speed   This is particularly useful for the de duplication process    Monitored backup   Backup processes are monitored by a third party monitoring center  This center alerts users to any errors that occur during automated backups  Monitored backup requires software capable of pinging the monitoring center s servers in the case of errors  Some monitoring services also allow collection of historical meta data  that can be used for Storage Resource Management purposes like projection of data growth  locating redundant primary storage capacity and reclaimable backup capacity  The Wizards Storage Portal is an example of a solution that monitors IBM s well known Tivoli Storage Manager TSM  solution      Lore      Wikiquote        Confusion     Due to a considerable overlap in technology  backups and backup systems are frequently confused with   archive  s and   fault tolerant system  s   Backups differ from archives in the sense that archives are the   primary copy   of data  usually put away for future use  while backups are a   secondary copy   of data  kept on hand to replace the original item  Backup systems differ from fault tolerant systems in the sense that backup systems assume that a fault   will   cause a data loss event and fault tolerant systems assure a fault   will not         Advice        Original research date November 2009     The more important the data that is stored on the computer  the greater is the need for backing up this data    A backup is only as useful as its associated restore strategy  For critical systems and data  the restoration process must be tested    Storing the copy near the original is unwise  since many disasters such as fire  flood  theft  and electrical surges are likely to cause damage to the backup at the same time  In these cases  both the original and the backup medium are likely to be lost    Automated backup and scheduling should be considered  as manual backups can be affected by human error    Backups can fail for a wide variety of reasons  A verification or monitoring strategy is an important part of a successful backup plan    Multiple backups on different media  stored in different locations  should be used for all critical information    Backed up archives should be stored in open and standard formats  especially when the goal is long term archiving  Recovery software and processes may have changed  and software may not be available to restore data saved in proprietary formats    System administrators and others working in the information technology field are routinely fired for not devising and maintaining backup processes suitable to their organization    If you already have a tape backup system  a second backup program may be necessary   Perform an additional backup to an external hard disk with an automatic backup program so you will have doubled the data security  and it is easy to check the backed up files in the external hard disk       Events       In 1996  during a fire at the headquarters of   Cr dit Lyonnais    a major bank in Paris  system administrators ran into the burning building to rescue backup

3271|Baire category theorem|The    Baire category theorem    is an important tool in   general topology   and   functional analysis    The theorem has two forms  each of which gives   sufficient condition  s for a   topological space   to be a   Baire space     The theorem was proved by   Ren  Louis Baire   in his 1899 doctoral thesis  ref Baire 1899  ref      Statement of the theorem    A   Baire space   is a topological space with the following property  for each   countable   collection of   Open set open     dense set  s   U sub n  sub     their intersection     U sub n  sub    is dense        BCT1     Every   complete metric space   is a Baire space   More generally  every topological space which is   homeomorphic   to an   open set open subset   of a   complete space complete     pseudometric space   is a Baire space  Thus every   completely metrizable   topological space is a Baire space       BCT2     Every   locally compact     Hausdorff space   is a Baire space  The proof is similar to the preceding statement  the   finite intersection property   takes the role played by completeness   Note that neither of these statements implies the other  since there are complete metric spaces which are not locally compact  the   irrational number  s with the metric defined below  also  any Banach space of infinite dimension   and there are locally compact Hausdorff space which are not   metrizable space metrizable    for instance  any uncountable product of non trivial compact Hausdorff spaces is such also   several function spaces used in Functional Analysis  the uncountable   Fort space     See   Counterexamples in Topology Steen and Seebach   in the references below        BCT3     A non empty complete metric space is NOT the countable union of   Nowhere dense set nowhere dense   sets  i e   sets whose closure has dense complement   This formulation is a consequence of BCT1 and is sometimes more useful in applications   Also  if a non empty complete metric space is the countable union of closed sets  then one of these closed sets has   non empty   interior      Relation to the axiom of choice    The proofs of    BCT1    and    BCT2    for arbitrary complete metric spaces require some form of the   axiom of choice    and in fact BCT1 is equivalent over ZF to a weak form of the axiom of choice called the   axiom of dependent choices    ref Blair 1977  ref   The restricted form of the Baire category theorem in which the complete metric space is also assumed to be separable is provable in ZF with no additional choice principles  ref Levy 1979  p  212  ref  This restricted form applies in particular to the real line  the   Baire space  set theory  Baire space     sup    sup   and the   Cantor space   2 sup    sup       Uses of the theorem       BCT1    is used to prove the   open mapping theorem  functional analysis  open mapping theorem    the   closed graph theorem   and the   uniform boundedness principle        BCT1    also shows that every complete metric space with no   isolated point  s is   uncountable     If   X   is a countable complete metric space with no isolated points  then each   singleton      x    in   X   is   nowhere dense    and so   X   is of   first category   in itself   In particular  this proves that the set of all   real number  s is uncountable      BCT1    shows that each of the following is a Baire space    The space    R    of   real number  s   The irrational numbers  with the metric defined by   d     x      y      1      n     1   where   n   is the first index for which the   continued fraction   expansions of   x   and   y   differ  this is a complete metric space    The   Cantor set    By    BCT2     every finite dimensional Hausdorff   manifold   is a Baire space  since it is locally compact and Hausdorff  This is so even for non paracompact  hence nonmetrizable  manifolds such as the   long line  topology  long line        Proof    The following is a standard proof that a complete metric space  math X  math  is a Baire space   Let  math U n  math  be a countable collection of open dense subsets  We want to show that the intersection  math  bigcap U n  math  is dense  A subset is dense if and only if every nonempty open subset intersects it  Thus  to show that the intersection is dense  it is sufficient to show that any nonempty open set  math W  math  has a point   x   in common with all of the  math U n  math   Since  math U 1  math  is dense   math W  math  intersects  math U 1  math   thus  there is a point  math x 1  math  and  math r 1   0  math

closure  respectively   Since  math U n  math  are dense  in a recursive manner  we find a pair of sequences  math x n  math  and  math r n   0  math  such that    math  overline B  x n  r n   subset B x  n 1   r  n 1    cap U n  math  as well as  math r n   1 n   math   Since  math x n  in B x m  r m   math  when  math n   m  math   we have that  math x n  math  is   Cauchy sequence Cauchy    and

3316|Bandwidth extension|   Bandwidth extension    of   Signal  electrical engineering  signal   is defined as the deliberate process of expanding the frequency range    Bandwidth  signal processing  bandwidth    of a signal in which it contains an appreciable and useful content  and or the frequency range in which its effects are such  Its significant advancement in recent years has led to the technology being adopted commercially in several areas including   Psychoacoustics psychacoustic   bass enhancement of small   loudspeaker  s and the high frequency enhancement of coded speech and audio    Bandwidth extension has been used in both speech and audio compression applications  The algorithms used in   G 729 1   and Spectral Band Replication  SBR  are two of many examples of bandwidth extension algorithms currently in use  In these methods  the low band of the spectrum is encoded using an existing codec  whereas the high band is coarsely parameterized using fewer parameters  Many of these bandwidth extension algorithms make use of the correlation between the low band and the high band in order to predict the wider band signal from extracted lower band features  Others encode the high band using very few bits  This is often sufficient since the ear is less sensitive to distortions in the high band compared to the low band       Bass Enhancement of Small Loudspeakers    Most often small loudspeakers are physically incapable of reproducing low frequency material  Using a psycho acoustical phenomenon like the   missing fundamental    perception of low frequencies can be greatly increased  By generating harmonics of lower frequencies and removing the lower frequencies themselves the suggestion is created that these frequencies are still remaining in the signal  This process is usually applied through external equipment or embedded in the speaker system using a digital signal processor    High frequency response can also be enhanced through generation of harmonics  Instead of mapping frequencies inside the reproducible region of the speaker  the speaker itself is used to generate frequencies outside the normal reproducible region  By boosting high frequencies and overdriving the speaker or amplifier slightly  higher harmonics can be generated      Bandwidth Extension of Speech in telephone systems    Telephone speech signals are usually very degraded in quality  Part of this degradation is due to the limited bandwidth used in the telephone systems  In most systems frequencies lower than 250 Hz are cut and bandwidth only extends to frequencies of 4 or 8 kHz  Using filtering and waveshaping low and high frequency response can be extended   By low pass filtering the lowest octave and half wave rectifying a waveform is created with a fundamental half of the original frequency  Due to the discontinuity in the waveform low pass filtering is needed to filter all harmonics  Using such a   subharmonic synthesizer   the essential frequency band between 125   250 Hz is recreated  adding weight to the signal   We can Isolate the top octave using high pass filters and generating harmonics extends high frequency bandwidth  The generation of harmonics can be done through a simple full wave rectification  which is computationally cheap and not amplitude dependent  As an alternative   single sideband modulation   can be used  giving precise control over the number and amplitude of the harmonics  In theory envelope estimation can be used to extract the original high frequency envelope and regenerating high frequencies using a noise source  The sparse information available in the small bandwidth will probably be too limited to extract a proper envelope      Bandwidth Extension of Audio       Spectral band replication    SBR  is a new technique that has gained popularity as an  add on  to popular   perceptual audio coding perceptual audio codecs   such as MP 3 and the   Advanced Audio Coding    AAC   New audio coders consisting of a marriage between SBR and the conventional audio coders have been formed  namely the   MP3Pro   and   AAC     In these algorithms  the lower spectrum is encoded using either MP 3 or AAC  whereas the high band is encoded using SBR  The key to the SBR algorithm is the information used to describe the high frequency portion of the signal  The primary design goal of this algorithm is to reconstruct the high band   spectrum   without introducing any   aliasing   artifacts and to provide good spectral and time resolution  A 64 band complex valued polyphase   filterbank   is used at the analysis portion  At the encoder  the filterbank is used to obtain energy samples of the original input signal s high band  These energy samples are then used as reference values for the envelope adjustment scheme used at the decoder     References      http   www dse nl  rmaarts     R M  Aarts  Erik Larsen and O  Ouweltjes  2003   A unified approach to low  and high

 Barbie stars as Corinne  a country girl from   Gascony   who dreams of being a   Musketeer Musketeers in France Musketeer    protectors of the French   House of Bourbon royal family    just like her father  D Artagnan  Now seventeen  Corinne asks her mother to let her go to Paris to become one  Though worried about the dangers  her mother supports her and gives Corinne her blessing  as well as a letter to Monsieur Treville  the captain of the Musketeers and an old friend of her father s    The next day before leaving  Corinne s mother reminds her about what her father use to say   True courage is pursuing your dream  even when everyone else says it s impossible   Hugging her mother goodbye  Corinne sets off for   Paris   with her   kitten    Miette  and Alexander  D Artagnan s old horse   Arriving in Paris  Corinne watches four Musketeers displaying their skills  She tells them about becoming a Musketeer herself and asks them where to find Treville  They tease her while a mean dog  Brutus  knocks her over and steals her letter  Attempting to get it back  Corinne and Miette chase him into the Musketeer headquarters  where Treville is talking to Philippe  the kingdom s regent Prince Louis s cousin and Brutus  owner  When hearing why she is there  Philippe scoffs at Corinne s dream to be a Musketeer  saying girls don t possess the proper skills  However  Treville kindly invites her inside    Feeling triumphant at first  she is disappointed when Treville says she s not ready for active duty  but he tells her to keep practicing and that if she needs anything  to come to him  After leaving  Corinne sits outside with Miette when Brutus sneaks up on them again and chases after Miette  While in pursuit  Corinne literally bumps into three other girls  Aramina a fashionista  Viveca a dancer and Ren e a violinist    She chases Miette and Brutus to the royal kitchen  where the cruel overseer  Madame de Boss   mistakes her as a new maid  Before being dragged off by her  Corinne helps an elderly servant named H l ne  who is touched by her kindness  Corinne is then introduced to three other maids  who turn out to be Viveca  Aramina and Ren e  Due to Corinne s earlier rampage  all three arrive extremely messy and disheveled  getting them in trouble with de Boss   who punishes them with extra work  Due to this  the girls have a sharp dislike for Corinne and give her the extra work while ignoring her in the process  However  by the end of the day and through her various good deeds  the three see Corinne has a kind heart and the four become friends    One day  while the four clean the great hall  Corinne meets Prince Louis  who is going to be crowned king shortly  Louis loves science and is currently developing a hot air balloon  As he begins to leave  a chandelier crashes down from the ceiling  barely missing the prince  As the debris flies towards them  each girl defends herself  Viveca whips out her cleaning towel  breaking a flying candle in half  Aramina swiftly kicks a piece of the candelabra in two  Renee throws her feather duster  knocking glass shards away from her and Corinne uses her broom in a sword like manner to bash away hanging crystals  Philippe and the Musketeers rush to Louis while H l ne  who was watching from the balcony  looks at the four girls in amazement  Philippe escorts a shaken Louis out of the hall  demanding that the cause of the accident be found at once     While removing the mess  Corinne notices the chandelier rope appears to have been cut  She also finds a small ruby on the floor near the rope handle  As they clean  the three other girls ask Corinne where she learned to move the way she did  She then tells them about her dream of becoming a Musketeer  Shocked  all three also shared their own ambition to become Musketeers themselves  Upon hearing this  H l ne has them follow her through a series of secret passages before arriving in a hidden chamber beneath the palace  She explains that the Musketeers used to train here before Treville moved them to the larger headquarters  She displays her own fighting abilities as she tests each girl  judging their level of skill  Afterwards  H l ne tells the girls that they are skilled  but they each have a long way to go  After they plead for her to teach them  H l ne starts training them  Each girl chooses a weapon of their choice and develops her own unique fighting style    That night  a furious Philippe confronts the captain of his guards  It is revealed that Philippe plans to have Louis assassinated so he can take over the kingdom and that the guard had cut the chandelier rope   his dagger is missing a ruby  Philippe orders the captain to sabotage Louis  hot air balloon  which the prince is planning to test the next day    Louis prepares to launch the balloon when the safety ropes  cut by the guard  break and the balloon blows away  The force of the jolt knocks the prince out of the basket and his foot gets stuck in the ladder  Corinne  who is washing the windows  sees Louis dangling upside down from the balloon ladder as it floats towards the towertop which is sharply pointed  She rushes onto the balcony and jumps into the balloon  preventing it from hitting the tower s spire  After she pulls him back up  Louis thanks her and she notices the severed ropes  After Corinne rescues him  Louis appears to have fallen in love with her  but she doesn t see it  As they continue flying  the two realize they have a lot in common  especially the desire to pursue their dreams no matter what  Louis tells Corinne that he longs to make inventions that will help people  but his biggest dream is to show that men can fly  Now  he fears he will have to give up his dreams when he becomes king  Corinne comforts him  saying that he can still make his dreams come true even if he is king and shares her own aspiration of being a Musketeer  But the prince  like other people  thinks that girls can t be Musketeers  which angers her  When they land  Corinne yells at Louis  saying  How is it  that a prince can imagine a man flying in the air  but not a girl as a musketeer   As she storms off  Louis is clearly sorry for hurting her feelings  Meanwhile  an infuriated Philippe watches from the palace     Later  down in the hidden chamber  H l ne and the girls are training while Corinne walks in and tells them what happened  As she does  she begins to notice a pattern with the accidents  especially the severed ropes  as Renee adds   Yesterday the chandelier  today his flying machine   It quickly becomes evident that a scheme of sabotage is in motion  Corinne shows the others the ruby she found and that she believes someone is trying to get rid of Louis  The girls think they should tell Treville  but H l ne tells them that until they have proof of a plot against the prince  they trust no one and for the girls to stay on their guard    Going home late one night  the four come across Philippe s captain and several of his men as they start opening crates full of fake swords for the prince s upcoming   masquerade ball    They hide and watch as the captain unsheathes a sword  showing a real one hidden inside  Shocked  the girls overhear the men   Conspiracy  political  plotting   to sneak the real swords into the ball and murder Louis  Corinne also notices the captain s snake headed dagger is missing a ruby in the hilt     The four friends rush back to the palace and find Treville speaking with Philippe in the ballroom  Not realizing Philippe is in on the assassination plot  they tell the men what they saw and heard  The regent immediately claims that any plot against the prince would be impossible and that the girls made up the story in an attempt to be made Musketeers  Trying to prove their case  Corinne opens a crate of the party swords to show them the real swords concealed inside  but all the swords are fake  Without any solid evidence  Treville believes Philippe and that an assassination on Louis would be impossible  though not that the girls made up the story    Philippe banishes them from the castle  threatening to throw them in the dungeons if they cause anymore unnecessary trouble  Back at their apartment  the girls are thoroughly depressed and consider giving up  but Corinne points out that even though no one believes them  they can t just walk away from everything they ve worked for  Inspired by her courage  the other three agree and make plans to sneak into the ball  Viveca makes their ball gowns and masks  Ren e disguises their weapons to blend in with their outfits while Aramina gives Corinne dancing lessons    When the ball started  Corinne gave her name as Lady Barbeque while the other girls chose different names  After the ball starts  Philippe s men take out Treville and the Musketeers on guard duty while a disguised Philippe and more men get the real swords  which are hidden in the secret tunnels  Elsewhere  the girls also use the tunnels to enter the ballroom  Once there  the four friends and H l ne keep their eyes open for trouble  When the fireworks begin  it holds everyone s attention so that the assassins can start their plan  But  Corinne sees Philippe about to stab Louis with a sword  She quickly cartwheels in between them and disarms Philippe  Philippe alerts everyone that the sword Corinne is holding is real    Realizing what s happening  the girls strip off their ball gowns  revealing their own Musketeer uniforms and weapons as they face off against the henchmen  As the battle starts  the terrified guests scatter while Philippe  who pretends to be on his side  drags Louis into the passageway  The girls hold their own against the assassins with H l ne and Miette s help  but they are soon overwhelmed as more henchmen arrive  Thinking quickly  Viveca uses a smoke bomb made by Ren e  blinding the guards and enabling the girls to escape into the tunnels and look for Louis   The prince soon realizes Philippe was behind the plot and runs when he tries to stab him  While searching for Louis  the girls find Treville and the other Musketeers tied up and free them  Viveca  Aramina and Ren e stay behind to help the Musketeers stop the remaining henchmen while Corinne goes after the prince      File Barbie and the Three Musketeers1 jpg thumb left 250px Corinne and the Three Musketeers    Louis  trying to escape Philippe  runs to the top of a tower and is cornered on a narrow ledge  As he slowly edges the prince towards the edge  Philippe tells Louis he s just a starly eyed inventor who isn t fit to be king  Corinne arrives  but is on an opposite balcony and can t reach them  Seeing a hanging banner  she grabs onto it and swings towards the men  Just as Philippe is about to shove Louis off the ledge  Corinne lets go of the banner  flips in midair and lands just in time between the prince and his cousin  Philippe and her engage in a fierce sword fight and with Louis  help  she is able to defeat him just as Treville and the others arrive  Philippe  his men and Brutus  who fought against Miette and lost  are all arrested and taken away  Louis thanks the girls and Treville apologizes for not believing them    After his coronation  the newly made King Louis rewards Corinne  Viveca  Aramina  and Ren e for their bravery by making them the first female Musketeers in history  Their families  fellow Musketeers and the citizens of Paris congratulate the girls  H l ne also attends the ceremony as the new overseer of the palace servants while Madame de Boss  is now a kitchen maid    Louis later invites Corinne to take another balloon ride with him  but the celebration is interrupted when the Musketeers are informed of a plot against the new king  Corinne tells Louis to hold on to the balloon ride offer as she runs to join her friends  Corrine  Viveca  Aramina and Ren e all ride into the sunset  lifting their swords and exclaiming

section date October 2010    While speaking to Treville  Corinne says her father s name is D Artagnan  D Artagnan is the one of the protagonists in the original novel   Like the hot blooded D Artagnan  Corinne is shown as a brave and feisty young woman who gets angry when people tell her that girls can t be Musketeers   Alexander  Corinne s horse  is a nod to the author of the Three Musketeers novel    Alexandre Dumas     When the other girls invited Corinne to stay with them  Viveca mentions that their former roommate was Constance  In the novel  Constance Bonacieux is the woman that D Artagnan falls in love with    One of the guests at the masquerade ball is introduced as the Countess De Winter  who was one of the antagonists from the original story   Monsieur Treville  the captain of the Musketeers in the film  is named after the captain in the original story  Monsieur de Treville   The part when Corinne accidentally falls on each of three girls and makes them angry is similar to the part in the novel when D Artagnan accidentally ends up falling into each of the Musketeers and making them challenge him to the duel    Corinne s hometown is Gascony  which is the name of D Artagnan s family estate in the novel   Prince Louis is named after King Louis XIII from the novel   Tim Curry  who voices Philippe in the film  also played the villainous Cardinal Richelieu in the 1993 Disney version of The Three Musketeers  The film also stars Charlie Sheen as Aramis  Kiefer Sutherland as Athos  Oliver Platt as Porthos and Chris O Donnell as D Artagnan    The famous fleur de lis  which was branded on the villainess Milady de Winter in the story  is on the fronts of the tunics worn by the Musketeers in the film    Aramina appears to be named after Aramis  another protagonist from the novel   However  Aramis  first name was Rene  so Renee appears to have been named after him  too   Paris  which is France s capital city and the center location of the original story  is also the location for the film    In the original novel  D Artagnan s father gives him a pony  And Corrine s mom gives her 15 crowns and the horse just like in the novel     Reception      Reviews    CommonSenseMedia s review gave the movie three stars out of five and concluded   A pretty good try  but this Musketeer misses the mark   Barbie does all kinds of acrobatic moves  which

3346|Barcode reader|  Image barcode scanner jpg thumb A handheld barcode scanner   A    barcode reader     or    barcode scanner     is an electronic device for reading printed   barcode  s  Like a   flatbed scanner    it consists of a light source  a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones  Additionally  nearly all barcode readers contain   decoder   circuitry analyzing the barcode s image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode s content to the scanner s output port      Types of barcode readers         Methods      Scanning methods are distinguished by the amount of operator manipulation required    Pen or wand type readers  requires the operator to swipe the pen over the code    Semi automatic handheld readers  The operator need not swipe  but must at least position the reader near the label   Fix mount readers for automatic reading  The reading is performed laterally passing the label over the reader  No operator is required  but the position of the code target must coincide with the imaging capability of the reader    Reader gates for automatic scanning  The position of the code must be just under the gate for short time  enabling the scanner sweep to capture the code target successfully       Types of technology      The reader types can be distinguished as follows        Pen type readers      Pen type readers consist of a light source and a   photodiode   that are placed next to each other in the tip of a pen or wand  ref name  denso wave  handheld illustrations     cite web    title Handheld barcode scanner technologies  illustrated    url http   www denso wave com en adcd fundamental barcode scanner html     ref  To read a bar code  the tip of the pen moves across the bars in a steady motion  The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source and generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the bar code  Dark bars in the bar code absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photo diode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the bar code  This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way   Morse code   dots and dashes are decoded        Laser scanners     Laser scanners work the same way as pen type readers except that they use a   laser   beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the bar code  ref name  denso wave  handheld illustrations     As with the pen type reader  a photodiode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code  In both pen readers and laser scanners  the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photodiode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same   modulation modulated   pattern        CCD readers        Charge coupled device CCD   readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader  Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it  Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row  a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row  The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself        Camera based readers      Two dimensional   machine vision imaging scanners   are the fourth and newest type of bar code reader  They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the bar code       Video camera readers    use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD bar code reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors  a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image  ref  http   katanshi com Products php Katanshi Barcode Reader    webcam based barcode reader     ref       Large field of view

able to cross all of the symbol s bars and spaces  no matter what the orientation   ref name  Palmer  Bar Code Book     cite book    author Roger C  Palmer     title The Bar Code Book    ref Palmer  Bar Code Book     ref   Omni directional scanners almost all use a laser  Unlike the simpler single line laser scanners  they produce a pattern of beams in varying orientations allowing them to read barcodes presented to it at different angles  Most of them use a single rotating polygonal mirror and an arrangement of several fixed mirrors to generate their complex scan patterns   Omni directional scanners are most familiar through the horizontal scanners in supermarkets  where packages are slid across a glass or sapphire window  There are a range of different omni directional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications  ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code  Omni directional scanners are also better at reading poorly printed  wrinkled  or even torn barcodes       Cell phone cameras     While cell phone cameras without auto focus are not ideal for reading some common barcode formats  there are 2D barcodes  such as   Semacode    which are optimized for cell phones  as well as QR Codes and Data Matrix codes which can be read quickly and accurately with or without auto focus  These open up a number of applications for consumers    Movies  DVD VHS movie catalogs   Music  CD catalogs  play

 a cordless barcode scanner is operated by a battery fitted inside it and is not connected to the electricity mains     Methods of connection        Early serial interfaces     Early barcode scanners  of all formats  almost universally used the then common   RS232   serial interface  This was an electrically simple means of connection and the software to access it is also relatively simple  although needing to be written for specific computers and their serial ports       Proprietary interfaces     There are a few other less common interfaces  These were used in large   Point of sale EPOS   systems with dedicated hardware  rather than attaching to existing commodity computers  In some of these interfaces  the scanning device returned a  raw  signal proportional to the intensities seen while scanning the barcode  This was then decoded by the host device  In some cases the scanning device would convert the symbology of the barcode to one that could be recognized by the host device  such as   Code 39         Keyboard wedges       Image Ps 2 ports jpg thumb right   PS 2 connector PS 2   keyboard and mouse ports   With the popularity of the   Personal computer PC   and its standard keyboard interface  it became ever easier to connect physical hardware to a PC and so there was commercial demand similarly to reduce the complexity of the associated software   Keyboard wedge  hardware plugged between the PC and its normal keyboard  with characters from the barcode scanner appearing exactly as if they had been typed at the keyboard  This made the addition of simple barcode reading abilities to existing programs very easy  without any need to change them  although it did require some care by the user and could be restrictive in the content of the barcodes that could be handled      USB    Later barcode readers began to use   Universal Serial Bus USB   connectors rather than the keyboard port  as this became a more convenient hardware option  To retain the easy integration with existing programs  a device driver called a  software wedge  could be used  to emulate the keyboard impersonating behaviour of the old  keyboard wedge  hardware   In many cases a choice of USB interface types    USB HID HID    CDC  are provided  Some have   Powered USB         Wireless networking     Modern handheld barcode readers are operated in   wireless network  s according to   IEEE 802 11g    WLAN  or   IEEE 802 15 3      Bluetooth     However  such configuration limits the time of operation from   Battery  electricity  battery   or   rechargeable battery   and required recharging at least after a shift of operation      Resolution     The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader  If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code  then it will overlap two elements  two spaces or two bars  and it may produce wrong output  On the other hand  if a too small dot of light is used  then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong   The most commonly used dimension is 13   Thou  unit of length  mils    0 33   millimetre mm     although some scanners can read codes with dimensions as small as 3 mils  Smaller bar codes must be printed at high resolution to be read accurately      See also        Point of sales       CueCat    a cat shaped handheld barcode

3389|Barycentric sum problem|  Combinatorial number theory   deals with   number theory number theoretic   problems which involve   combinatorics combinatorial   ideas in their formulations or solutions    Paul Erd s   is the main founder of this branch of number theory  Typical topics include   covering system      zero sum problem  s  various   restricted sumset  s  and   arithmetic progression  s in a set of integers  Algebraic or analytic methods are powerful in this field    In combinatorial number theory  the    barycentric sum problems    are questions that can be answered using combinatorial techniques  The context of barycentric sum problems are the barycentric sequences     Example    Let  math Z n  math  be the cyclic group of integers modulo   n    Let   S   be a sequence of elements of  math Z n  math   where the repetition of elements is allowed  Let  math  S   math  be the length of   S    A sequence  math S  subseteq Z n  math  with  math  S   geq 2  math  is barycentric or has a barycentric sum if it contains one element  math a j  math  such that  math  sum limits   a i  in S  a i  S a j  math    Informally  if  math S  math  contains one element  math a j  math   which is the  average  of its terms  A barycentric sequence of length  math t  math  is called a t barycentric sequence  Moreover when   S   is a set  the term barycentric set is used instead of barycentric sequence  For example  the set  0 1 2 3 4    math  subseteq Z 8  math  is 5 barycentric with barycenter 2  however the set   0 2 3 4 5   math  subseteq Z 8  math  is not 5 barycentric  The barycentric sum problem consist in finding the smallest integer   t   such that any sequence of length   t   contains   a   k   barycentric sequence for some given   k   The study of the existence of such t related with k and the study of barycentric constants are part of the barycentric sum problems  It has been introduced by Ordaz  ref C  Delorme  S  Gonz lez  O  Ordaz and M T

every sequence of length  math n   k   1   math  in  math Z n  math  contains a k barycentric sequence  Notice that a   k   barycentric sequence in  math Z n  math   with k a multiple of n  is a sequence with zero sum  The   zero sum problem   on sequences started in 1961 with the Erd s  Ginzburg and Ziv theorem  every sequence of length  math 2n 1  math  in an   abelian group   of order   n

3473|Bayes linear statistics|   Bayes linear statistics    is a subjectivist statistical methodology and framework   Traditional subjective Bayesian analysis is based upon fully specified probability distributions  which are very difficult to specify at the necessary level of detail   Bayes linear analysis attempts to solve this problem by developing theory and practise for using partially specified probability models   Bayes linear in its current form has been primarily developed by Michael Goldstein   Mathematically and philosophically it extends   Bruno de Finetti   s   Operational Subjective   approach to probability and statistics   Consider first a traditional Bayesian Analysis where you expect to shortly know   D   and you would like to know more about some other observable   B     In the traditional Bayesian approach it is required that every possible outcome is enumerated i e  every possible outcome is the cross product of the   partition of a set   of   B   and   D     If represented on a computer where   B   requires   n   bits and   D     m   bits then the number of states required is   2 sup n m  sup      The first step to such an analysis is to determine a persons subjective probabilities e g  by asking about their betting behaviour for each of these outcomes   When we learn   D   conditional probabilities for   B   are determined by the application of Bayes  rule   Practitioners of subjective Bayesian statistics routinely analyse datasets where the size of this set is large enough that subjective probabilities cannot be meaningfully determined for every element of   D  times  B     This is normally accomplished by assuming   exchangeability   and then the use of parameterized models with prior distributions over parameters and appealing to the   de Finetti s theorem   to justify that this produces valid operational subjective probabilities over   D  times  B     The difficulty with such an approach is that the  validity of the statistical analysis requires that the subjective probabilities are a good representation of an individual s beliefs however this method results in a very precise specification over   D  times  B   and it is often difficult to articulate what it would mean to adopt these belief specifications   In contrast to the traditional Bayesian paradigm Bayes linear statistics following de Finetti uses   Prevision   or subjective expectation as a primitive  probability is then defined as the expectation of an indicator variable   Instead of specifying a subjective probability for every element in the partition   D  times  B   the analyst specifies subjective expectations for just a few quantities that they are interested in or feel knowledgeable about   Then instead of conditioning an adjusted expectation is computed by a rule that is a generalization of Bayes  rule that is based upon expectation   The use of the word linear in the title refers to de Finetti s arguments that probability theory is a linear theory  de Finetti argued against the more common measure theory approach          Example   In Bayes linear statistics  the probability model is only partially specified it is not possible to calculate conditional probability by Bayes  rule   Instead Bayes linear suggests the calculation of an Adjusted Expectation   To conduct a Bayes linear analysis it is necessary to identify some values that you expect to know shortly by making measurements   D   and some future value which you would like to know   B     Here   D   refers to a vector containing data and   B   to a vector containing quantities you would like to predict   For the following example   B   and   D   are taken to be two dimensional vectors i e     math B    Y 1 Y 2    D    X 1 X 2    math   In order to specify a Bayes linear model it is necessary to supply expectations for the vectors   B   and   D    and to also specify the correlation between each component of   B   and each component of   D       For example the expectations are specified as       math E Y 1  5  E Y 2  3  E X 1  5  E X 2  3  math   and the covariance matrix is specified as       math   begin matrix           X 1         X 2         Y 1         Y 2        X 1        1         u            gamma          gamma        X 2        u         1            gamma          gamma        Y 1         gamma        gamma         1           v          Y 2         gamma        gamma         v           1           end matrix     math   The repetition in this matrix  has some interesting implications to be discussed shortly   An adjusted expectation is a linear estimator of the form     math c 0   c 1X 1   c 2X 2  math   where  math c 0  c 1  math  and  math c 2  math  are chosen to minimise the prior expected loss for the observations i e   math Y 1  Y 2  math  in this case   That is for  math Y 1  math      math E  Y 1   c 0   c 1X 1   c 2X 2  2     math   where     math c 0  c 1  c 2    math   are chosen in order to minimise the prior expected loss in estimating  math Y 1  math   In general the adjusted expectation is calculated with     math E D X     sum k  i 0  h iD i    math   Setting  math h 0   dots  h k  math  to minimise     math E left  left X  sum k  i 0 h iD i right  2 right     math   From a proof provided in  Goldstein and Wooff 2007  it can be shown that      math E D X    E X    Cov X D Var D    1  D E D         math   For the case where Var   D    is not invertible the   Moore Penrose pseudoinverse   should be used instead     See also      Imprecise probability       External links      http   maths dur ac

3476|Bayesian average|  Cleanup date June 2009     Unreferenced date December 2009    A    Bayesian average    is a method of estimating the   mean   of a population consistent with   Bayesian probability Bayesian interpretation    where instead of estimating the mean strictly from the available data set  other existing information related to that data set may also be incorporated into the calculation in order to minimize the impact of large deviations  or to assert a default value when the data set is small   For example  in a calculation of an average review score of a book where only two reviews are available  both giving scores of 10  a normal average score would be 10  However  as only two reviews are available  10 may not represent the true average had more reviews been available  The review site may instead calculate a Bayesian average of this score by adding the average review score of all books in the store to the calculation  For example  by adding five scores of 7 each  the Bayesian average becomes 7 86 instead of 10  which the review site would hope that it will better represent the quality of the book   Note that the additional information incorporated into the mean calculation does not have to be the true prior mean of the larger population  but rather a value subjectively determined by the person calculating the average as relevant and serving the purpose of the calculation  Therefore  the quality of the Bayesian average  in term of representing the data set  is dependent on the judgment of the person doing the calculation     Calculation   Calculating the Bayesian average uses the prior mean   m   and a constant   C      C   is assigned a value that is proportional to the typical data set size  The value is larger when the expected variation between data sets  within the larger population  is small  It is smaller  when the data sets are expected to vary substantially from one another      math   bar x     Cm    sum  i 1  n x i   over C   n     math   In cases where the averages  relative values are the only result of importance    m   can be replaced with zero    C   can be calculated based on the priors regarding variance between data sets  In circumstances where that kind of rigor is desired  other more expressive measures of   statistical power   are likely to be used  As a result    C   is usually assigned a value in an   ad hoc   manner      Example    The goal is to calculate the Bayesian average of the heights of various occupations of adult American men  In the larger population of adult American men  the   average height   is 176 cm  A value of   C   is chosen as 10  For the purpose of this example  the occupations used will be  Basketball Players    Actors  and  Students   For the basketball players  a group of 15 individuals are identified with an average height of 191 cm among them  For the students  a group of 10 individuals is identified with an average height of 179 cm  For the actors  only   James Cromwell   is available  for an average height of 201 cm      border  1  rules  all   Group    N    Group   mean    Bayesian average     Basketball players  15  191 cm  185 cm     Students  10  179 cm  177 5 cm     Actors  1  201 cm  178 cm     Here  the Bayesian average correctly reduces the effect of a single anomalously large value  If the sample sizes for basketball players were similarly small  the Bayesian average would have mis estimated basketball players as being far closer to average      See also         Additive smoothing      Category Bayesian statistics      statistics stub

3517|Beam propagation method|   Beam Propagation Method     BPM  refers to a computational technique in   Electromagnetics    used to solve the   Helmholtz equation   under conditions of a   time harmonic wave    BPM works under   slowly varying envelope approximation    for linear and nonlinear equations   The    beam propagation method     BPM  is an approximation technique for simulating the propagation of   light   in slowly varying optical   waveguide  s  It is essentially the same as the so called   Parabolic Equation    PE  method in underwater   acoustics    Both BPM and the PE were first introduced in 1970 s  When a wave propagates along a waveguide for a large distance  larger compared with the wavelength   rigorous numerical simulation is difficult  The BPM relies on approximate differential equations which are also called the one way models  These one way models involve only a first order   derivative   in the variable z  for the waveguide axis  and they can be solved as  initial  value problem  The  initial  value problem does not involve time  rather it is for the spatial variable z  ref   citation title Integrated Photonics author Clifford R  Pollock

The original BPM and PE were derived from the slowly varying envelope approximation and they are the so called paraxial one way models  Since then  a number of improved one way models are introduced  They come from a one way model involving a square root operator  They are obtained by applying rational approximations to the square root operator  After a one way model is obtained  one still has to solve it by discretizing the variable z  However  it is possible to merge the two steps  rational approximation to the square root operator and discretization of z  into one step  Namely  one can find rational approximations to the so called one way propagator  the exponential of the square root operator  directly  The rational approximations are not trivial  Standard diagonal Pad  approximants have trouble with the so called evanescent modes  These evanescent modes should decay rapidly in z  but the diagonal Pad  approximants will incorrectly propagate them as propagating modes along the waveguide  Modified rational approximants that can suppress the evanescent modes are now available  The accuracy of the BPM can be further improved  if you use the energy conserving one way model or the single scatter one way model     Principles   BPM is generally formulated as a solution to Helmholtz equation in a time harmonic case    ref Okamoto K  2000 Fundamentals of Optical Waveguides  San

calculate the field at all points of space for all times  we only need to compute the function  math A x y   math  for all space  and then we are able to reconstruct  math  psi x y z   math   Since the solution is for the time harmonic Helmholtz equation  we only need to calculate it over one time period  We can  visualize the fields along the propagation direction  or the cross section waveguide modes   The master equation is discretized  using various centralized difference  crank nicholson scheme etc   and rearranged in a causal fashion  Through iteration the field evolution is computed  along the propagation direction     Applications   BPM is a quick and easy method of solving for fields in integrated optical devices  It is typically used only in solving for intensity and modes within shaped  bent  tapered  terminated  waveguide structures  as opposed to scattering problems  These structures typically consist of   isotropic   optical materials  but the BPM has also

1999  but consumer demand led them to reconsider  In 2000  a Beanie Baby named  The Beginning  was introduced to remind people of Beanie Babies  comeback     Teenie Beanies    an offshoot of the Beanie Babies line  were made by additional manufacturers for a few   McDonalds     Happy Meal   promotions  They are not new Beanie Babies  but Beanie Babies in a smaller size     Sociology of Beanie Babies   The phenomenon of Beanie Babies is an example of a product of   popular culture    Based on the sales and revenue of this toy  Ty Warner Inc  created an empire worth over  6 billion  In 1995  there was fear that the public was losing interest in this hot commodity  In fact  demand was increasing significantly  resulting in a profit of  250 million in the following year  with substantial re sale value in the secondary market  In 2008 Ty  Inc  released a follow up line    Beanie Babies 2 0    for use on online games on the Ty website      Marketing strategies    Much of the success of Beanie Babies can be attributed to the marketing strategies of the company  ref Becker  H  S   1982   Art Worlds and Collective Activity  Art Worlds  1 39   ref  The ten strategies employed by Ty Warner included    Reasonable Price    Ty Warner   wanted to keep Beanie Babies selling at a reasonable price  but did not want to mass produce them  In doing so  he followed steps 4 and 5 by limiting production and distribution by only selling to smaller retailers    Keep it Secretive    Ty Warner   was able to keep people interested because they weren t jaded by the constant advertisements that most large toy companies use  when people don t know what to expect  it becomes more appealing    Surprise People  Unpredictability became entertaining to the mass public and made people even more eager to engage in the collection process of Beanie Babies    Limit Production  Limiting production ensured that keeping some Beanie Babies rare would keep people excited    Avoid Large Chain Retailers  Unlike most toys that are mass produced and retailed to major toy stores  Beanie Babies were sold at smaller  more refined specialty shops  This helped sustain the authentic image of Beanie Babies    Simplicity  Because only a few different colors of fabric were used for each Beanie Baby  costs were kept low  At the same time  this simplicity appealed to everyone because what they saw is what they got    Personification  Personification made Beanie Babies easier to relate to  every Beanie Baby had a Ty tag with a unique name  birthday  and poem  This only increased the excitement of the buyers because it was no longer just a   stuffed animal      Variety  Producing a variety of Beanie Babies attracted everyone because this tactic aims to please everyone s taste  This ploy also made serious collectors more eager to collect every Beanie Baby out there    Retirements  Retirement created frenzy among Beanie Baby consumers  When Ty would retire a certain Beanie Baby  demand would increase  while supply came to a halt    Risk  Every previous strategy that Warner developed was a risk  and he succeeded in going against the norm  ref Ty Warner s Marketing Strategy   2008

other collectibles like   Neopets   and   Webkinz        Tags    The tags on Beanie Babies are considered a very important part when assessing their orverall value  It is widely believed by collectors that a Beanie without a tag or a damaged tag loses up to half of its value  Every Beanie Baby has least two factory made tags  a   swing tag    also known as a  hang tag    ear tag  or  name tag   which includes the beanies name  date of birth and a small story  There is also the   tush tag    usually attached to the Beanie s rear end   Both tags have gone through many changes over time  these changes have become known as  generations   There are currently 15 generations of swing tags and 13 generations of tush tags  Additionally  there are also extra tags for certain regions that include things like safety information to comply with the Canadian   Stuffed Articles Act   or the   CE Mark   requirements in   Europe      A few tag  generations  have become particularly noteworthy  Most Beanie Babies with first  second  or third generation hang tags have held their value  or in the case of some harder to find styles  increased in value   while fourth and fifth generation hang tags

3547|Bedrock  framework |   Bedrock    was a joint effort by   Apple Inc  Apple Computer   and   Symantec   to produce a   cross platform cross platform   programming   Software framework framework   for writing applications on the   Macintosh Apple Macintosh   and   Microsoft Windows   platforms  The project was a failure for various political reasons  and after delivering a beta version the project died in late 1993   Bedrock started as an internal effort at Symantec in the early 1990s  At the time many of Symantec s products ran on both Mac and Windows  and Bedrock was intended to ease the effort of keeping both platforms up to date  Symantec was also the supplier of the premier development platform on the Mac    Think C    which included an application framework of its own    Think Class Library TCL     At about the same time Apple had delivered the latest version of their own framework    MacApp    The upgrade to 3 0 had not gone smoothly  due largely to a switch in language from   Object Pascal   to   C      Applications written in earlier versions of MacApp had to be completely re written for 3 0  and even the new version didn t support many of the new features introduced in   System 7    or at least not well  Making matters worse was that their development environment    Macintosh Programmer s Workshop MPW    was hopelessly outdated and completely un Mac like  At some point the system would have to be replaced outright  by something that would likely look a lot like Think C   Adding to the concern was the ongoing rise of Windows  which had finally matured into a usable system that would run on the average machine of the era  Cross platform systems became something of a holy grail in the Mac developer community  but most efforts up to that point had resulted in lowest common denominator products that looked like neither platform and were generally detested   A collaboration between Apple and Symantec thus seemed natural  In early 1992 they first mentioned a cross platform strategy in the flier for   Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC  92    and talked about it very briefly at the show  calling it     Cross Platform Framework    and mentioning that more would be revealed at the MacWorld show in June  At the show they announced the concept as Bedrock  with plans to expand it in the future to support   Unix      OS 2      Windows NT   and   Taligent    The first releases would be officially supported by Apple s follow on for MPW and Symantec s Think C on the Mac  and Symantec s Zortech C   on Windows  Although not officially supported  the system would be deliberately written to be able to compile under any C   compiler  As the follow on to MacApp  development of that product was stopped to concentrate solely on Bedrock   While it appeared that the effort was a joint project  in fact the entire development was being carried out by Symantec  a fact that slowly became apparent during the year  Developers started commenting about the dangerous position this placed Apple in  leaving their future development platform in the hands of a 3rd party  It appeared that Apple had completely abandoned the tools market  which may have not been far from the truth at that time  Making matters considerably worse was the fact that Symantec s CEO had given up on the Mac  and even publicly announced that Windows was the future   A developer s preview was delivered in the spring of 1993 that included several demo apps built using the system  These apps looked nothing like Mac or Windows programs  using custom UI widgets for many common tasks like Open File dialog boxes  Furthermore the applications were simply downright ugly  buttons didn t line up  dialogs had spelling mistakes and bad grammar  and the menu bar often included the same command in several menus  Few previews have been so effective at ensuring the failure of a project  with the possible exception of   Copland  operating system  Copland      Throughout this period Apple was also working on   OpenDoc    positioning it as a unique document centered technology that led to a better user experience than monolithic applications  Apple was particularly effective in  selling  the OpenDoc concept to end users and developers  and the obvious contradiction between working on Bedrock while claiming classic applications were outmoded led to infighting between the project teams in Apple   In January 1994 Apple finally made the obvious official  and stated that the Bedrock efforts were no longer taking place with Symantec  Instead  Apple took out a perpetual license for the software and was re purposing it an OpenDoc development platform  How this was to be accomplished was not clear  and the announcement was generally taken to be a death knell  ndash  which it was  All mention of Bedrock quickly disappeared from both company s public statements  although various parts of the technology showed up in products from both companies over the years  Apple was left with the programming framework and development platform they had two years earlier  and native support for the   PowerPC   was still spotty  at best  If not for the  upstarts  at   Metrowerks    developers may have abandoned Apple entirely   In the end the effort served as yet another example of the problems Apple was having at the time  After largely ignoring the developer tools market until 3rd parties had completely surpassed them  they suddenly found themselves with no compelling tools just when Windows was starting to break out  Their desperate attempts to address the problem resulted in a string of failed projects  Bedrock    Dylan  programming language  Dylan      Apple Open Collaboration Environment AOCE   and  eventually  OpenDoc among them

3560|Behavior Driven Development|  Essay like date June 2010       Behavior driven development     or    BDD     is an   agile software development   technique that encourages collaboration between developers    quality assurance QA   and non technical or business participants in a software project  It was originally named in 2003 by Dan North ref name  origin  D North   http   dannorth net introducing bdd Introducing Behaviour Driven Development   ref  as a response to   Test Driven Development    including Acceptance Test or Customer Test Driven Development practices as found in   Extreme Programming    It has evolved over the last few years ref name  evolution  D North  comments   http   forums pragprog com forums 95 topics 3035 The RSpec Book   Question about Chapter 11  Writing software that matters   ref    On the  Agile Specifications  BDD and Testing eXchange  in November 2009 in London  Dan North ref Dan North   http   skillsmatter com podcast java jee how to sell bdd to the business How to sell BDD to the business   ref  gave the following definition of BDD   blockquote  BDD is a second generation  outside in  pull based  multiple stakeholder  multiple scale  high automation  agile methodology  It describes a cycle of interactions with well defined outputs  resulting in the delivery of working  tested software that matters   blockquote   BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion with stakeholders  It extends   test driven development TDD   by writing test cases in a natural language that non programmers can read  Behavior driven developers use their native language in combination with the   ubiquitous language   of   domain driven design   to describe the purpose and benefit of their code  This allows the developers to focus on why the code should be created  rather than the technical details  and minimizes translation between the technical language in which the code is written and the domain language spoken by the business  users  stakeholders  project management  etc   Dan North created the first ever BDD framework  JBehave ref name  origin      followed by a story level BDD framework for Ruby called RBehave ref name  rbehave  D North   http   dannorth net 2007 06 introducing rbehave Introducing RBehave   ref  which was later integrated into the   RSpec   project ref name  rbehave integ  S Miller   http   www infoq com news 2007 10 RSpec incorporates RBehave InfoQ  RSpec incorporates RBehave   ref   He also worked with  David Chelimsky  Aslak Helles y and others to develop RSpec and also to write  The RSpec Book  Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec  Cucumber  and Friends   The first story based framework in RSpec was later replaced by  http   cukes info  Cucumber  mainly developed by Aslak Helles y    In 2008  Chris Matts  who was involved in the first discussions around BDD  came up with the idea of Feature Injection ref name  feature injection  Chris Matts   http   picasaweb google co uk chris matts FeatureInjection  Feature Injection   ref   allowing BDD to cover the analysis space and provide a full treatment of the   software lifecycle   from vision through to code and release     BDD practices    The practices of BDD include    Establishing the goals of different stakeholders required for a vision to be implemented   Drawing out features which will achieve those goals using    Feature injection feature injection     Involving stakeholders in the implementation process through   outside in software development     Using examples to describe the behavior of the application  or of units of code   Automating those examples to provide quick feedback and   regression testing     Using  should  when describing the behavior of software to help clarify responsibility and allow the software s functionality to be questioned   Using  ensure  when describing responsibilities of software to differentiate outcomes in the   Scope  programming  scope   of the code in question from side effects of other elements of code    Using   Mock object mocks   to stand in for collaborating modules of code which have not yet been written    Feature injection    A company may have several visions which will deliver value to the business  usually by making money  saving money or protecting money  Once a vision is identified by a group as being the best vision for the conditions  they will need additional help to make the vision a success   The primary stakeholders who have identified the vision then bring in incidental stakeholders  Each stakeholder defines the goals they need to achieve in order for the vision to be successful  For example  a legal department might ask for certain regulatory requirements to be met  The head of marketing might want to engage the community who will be using the software  A security expert will make sure that the software won t be vulnerable to   SQL injection   attacks   From these goals  broad themes or feature sets are defined which will achieve them  for instance   allow users to rank contributions  or  audit transactions    From these themes  user features and the first details of the user interface can be established     Outside in    BDD is driven by   business value   ref name  nottdddonewell  E Keogh   http   lizkeogh com 2007 06 13 bdd tdd done well  BDD   TDD done well    ref   that is  the benefit to the business which accrues once the application is in production  The only way in which this benefit can be realized is through the   user interface   s  to the application  usually  but not always  a   GUI     In the same way  each piece of code  starting with the UI  can be considered a stakeholder of the other modules of code which it uses  Each element of code provides some aspect of behavior which  in collaboration with the other elements  provides the application behavior   The first piece of production code that BDD developers implement is the UI  Developers can then benefit from quick feedback as to whether the UI looks and behaves appropriately  Through code  and using principles of good design and refactoring  developers discover collaborators of the UI  and of every unit of code thereafter  This helps them adhere to the principle of   YAGNI    since each piece of production code is required either by the business  or by another piece of code already written     Application examples    The requirements of a retail application might be   Refunded or replaced items should be returned to stock    In BDD  a developer or QA engineer might clarify the requirements by breaking this down into specific examples  e g      Scenario 1  Refunded items should be returned to stock      Given a customer previously bought a black sweater from me   and I currently have three black sweaters left in stock   when he returns the sweater for a refund   then I should have four black sweaters in stock      Scenario 2  Replaced items should be returned to stock      Given that a customer buys a blue garment   and I have two blue garments in stock   and three black garments in stock    When he returns the garment for a replacement in black    Then I should have three blue garments in stock   and two black garments in stock  Each scenario is an   exemplar    designed to illustrate a specific aspect of behavior of the application   When discussing the scenarios  participants question whether the outcomes described always result from those events occurring in the given context  This can help to uncover further scenarios which clarify the requirements ref name  whatsinastory  D North   http   dannorth net whats in a story What s in a Story   ref   For instance  a domain expert noticing that refunded items are not always returned to stock might reword the requirements as  Refunded or replaced items should be returned to stock unless faulty    This in turn helps participants to pin down the scope of requirements  which leads to better estimates of how long those requirements will take to implement   The words Given  When and Then are often used to help drive out the scenarios  but are not mandated   These scenarios can also be automated  if an appropriate tool exists to allow automation at the UI level  If no such tool exists then it may be possible to automate at the next level in  i e   if an   Model view controller MVC   design pattern has been used  the level of the Controller     Unit level examples and behavior    The same principles of examples  using contexts  events and outcomes are used to drive development at a unit level  For instance  the following examples describe an aspect of behavior of a list   Example 1  New lists are empty   Given a new list   Then the list should be empty   Example 2  Lists with things in them are not empty    Given a new list   When we add an object   Then the list should not be empty   Both these examples are required to describe the behavior of the  source lang  java  list isEmpty    source  method  and to derive the benefit of the method  These examples are usually automated using TDD frameworks  In BDD these examples are often encapsulated in a single method  with the name of the method being a complete description of the behavior  Both examples are required for the code to be valuable  and encapsulating them in this way makes it easy to question  remove or change the behaviour   For instance  using   Java  programming language  Java   and   JUnit   4  the above examples might become    source lang  java   public class ListTest        Test    public void shouldKnowWhetherItIsEmpty           List list1   new List          assertTrue list1 isEmpty            List list2   new List          list2 add new Object           assertFalse list2 isEmpty              source   Other practitioners  particularly in the Ruby community  prefer to split these into two separate examples  based on separate contexts for when the list is empty or has items in  This technique is based on Dave Astels  practice   One assertion per test ref name  oneassertion  D  Astels   http   techblog daveastels com tag bdd  One assertion per test   ref     Sometimes the difference between the context  events and outcomes is made more explicit  For instance    source lang  java   public class WindowControlBehavior         Test     public void shouldCloseWindows                         Given         WindowControl control   new WindowControl  My AFrame            AFrame frame   new AFrame                        When         control closeWindow                        Then         ensureThat  frame isShowing                      source   However the example is phrased  the effect describes the behavior of the code in question  For instance  from the examples above one can derive     List should know when it is empty   WindowControl should close windows  The description is intended to be useful if the test fails  and to provide documentation of the code s behavior  Once the examples have been written they are then run and the code implemented to make them work in the same way as TDD  The examples then become part of the suite of regression tests     Using mocks    BDD proponents claim that the use of  should  and  ensureThat  in BDD examples encourages developers to question whether the responsibilities they re assigning to their classes are appropriate  or whether they can be delegated or moved to another class entirely  Practitioners use an object which is simpler than the collaborating code  and provides the same interface but more predictable behavior  This is   Dependency Injection injected   into the code which needs it  and examples of that code s behavior are written using this object instead of the production version   These objects can either be created by hand  or created using a mocking framework such as   Mockito      Moq      NMock      Rhino Mocks      JMock   or   EasyMock     Questioning responsibilities in this way  and using mocks to fulfill the required roles of collaborating classes  encourages the use of   Role based Interfaces    It also helps to keep the classes small and loosely coupled     References     Reflist      External links     http   dannorth net introducing bdd Dan North s article introducing BDD    http   behavior driven org  Introduction to

3563|Behavior of DEVS|Behaviors of a given   DEVS   model is a set of sequences of timed events including null events  called   Event Segment event segments   which make the model move one state to another within a set of legal states  To define this way  the concept of a set of illegal state as well a set of legal states are needed to be introduced    In addition  since the behaviors of a given

Heidegger   s     Being and Time      an   ontology ontological   investigation through the lens and method of   Edmund Husserl Husserlian     Phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenology    Husserl was Heidegger s teacher   Reading   Being and Time   initiated Sartre s own enquiry leading to the publication in 1943 of   Being and Nothingness   whose subtitle is  A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology   Sartre s essay is clearly influenced by Heidegger though Sartre was profoundly skeptical of any measure by which humanity could achieve a kind of personal state of fulfillment comparable to the hypothetical Heideggerian re encounter with Being  In his much gloomier account in   Being and Nothingness    man is a creature haunted by a vision of  completion   what Sartre calls the   List of Latin phrases  E   ens causa sui      and which religions identify as God   Born into the material reality of one s body  in an all too material universe  one finds oneself inserted into being  with a lower case  b    Consciousness is in a state of cohabitation with its material body  but has no objective reality  it is nothing   no thing    Consciousness has the ability to conceptualize possibilities  and to make them appear  or to annihilate them     Introduction   In the introduction  Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness  being and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists  most notably   Edmund Husserl Husserl   and   Martin Heidegger Heidegger    as well as   idealism idealists      rationalism rationalists   and   empiricism empiricists    According to him one of the major achievements of modern philosophy has been to free us of the kinds of dualism that set the existent up as having a  hidden  nature as with   Immanuel Kant Kant   s   noumenon    Phenomenology has removed  the illusion of worlds behind the scene   ref Being and Nothingness  p  2   ref   Based on an examination of the nature of phenomena  he describes the nature of two aspects of being  being in itself and being for itself  While being in itself is something that can only be approximated  a sort of being that can only be imagined as itself if it is imagined without a witnessing consciousness  being for itself is the being of consciousness     Part 1  Chapter 1  The origin of negation   When we go about the world  we have expectations which are often not fulfilled   For example  Pierre is not at the caf  where we thought we would meet him  so there is a   negation    a void  a nothingness  in the place of Pierre  When looking for Pierre his lack of being there becomes a negation  everything he sees as he searches the people and objects about him are  not Pierre   ref   L  tre et le n ant    p  45  Barnes  p  9  ref  So Sartre claims  It is evident that non being always appears within the limits of a human expectation    ref   L  tre et le n ant    p  41  Barnes  p  7  ref     Part 1  Chapter 2  Bad faith     Bad faith  existentialism  Bad faith   or  Self Deception   as translations vary  can be understood as the guise of existing as a character  individual or person who defines himself through the social categorization of his formal identity  This essentially means that in being a waiter  grocer  etc  one must believe that his or her social role is equivalent to his or her human existence  Living a life defined by one s occupation  social  racial or economic class  is the very faith of  bad faith   the condition in which people cannot transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be  human  and what they are not  a grocer  etc     It is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what Sartre calls the  great human stream   The great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything  in reference to our situation  that we desire    The possibility of playing is afforded by time and situation  It isn t difficult to see how Sartre s ideas are linked to post modernist structural claims offered by   Michel Foucault    However  the theories differ vastly with regard to human identity    In any light  the difference in existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition  their  bad faith   One of the most widely discussed examples of projection  via   Freud   s conception of the human mind  that Sartre uses is the caf  waiter who performs the duties  traditions  functions and expectations of a cafe waiter       W hat   are we   then if we have the constant obligation to make ourselves what   we are   if our mode of being is having the obligation to be what we are  Let us consider this waiter in the cafe  His movement is quick and forward  a little too precise  a little too rapid  He bends forward a little too eagerly  his voice  his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer  Finally there he returns  trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight rope walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable  perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand  All his behavior seems to us a game  He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms  the one regulating the other  his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms  he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things  He is playing  he is amusing himself  But what is he playing  We need not watch long before we can explain it  he is playing at   being    a waiter in a cafe  There is nothing there to surprise us    Sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith  one must realize that his or her existence and his formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control  This separation is a form of   nothingness    Nothingness  in terms of bad faith  is characterized by Sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity  and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner  An example is   something that is what it is    existence  and   something that is what it is not    a waiter defined by his occupation    Yet  Sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of  mere social positions   I am never any one of my attitudes  any one of my actions  The good speaker is the one who   plays   at speaking because he cannot   be speaking    This literally means that  like the cafe waiter  the speaker is not his condition or social categorization  but is a speaker consumed by bad faith  Thus  we must realize what we are  beings who exist  and what we are not  a social  historical  preoccupation  in order to step out of bad faith  Yet  existents  human beings  must maintain a balance between existence  their roles and nothingness to become authentic beings      Additionally  an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of good faith in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence  The authentic domain of bad faith  is realizing that the role we are playing is the lie  The goal of authenticity can be traced back to   Dostoevsky Dostoevsky s     Notes from Underground    Dostoevsky has been called  The Grandfather of existentialism   To live and project into the future as a project of a self  while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically  This is perhaps one of the main goals of Sartre s opus    One of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional   ethics   and morality  Being a  moral person  requires one to deny authentic impulses  everything that makes us human   and allow the will of another person to change one s actions  Being a moral person is one of the most severe forms of bad faith  Essentially Sartre characterizes this as  the faith of bad faith  which is and should not be  in Sartre s opinion  at the heart of one s existence  Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional morality  condemning it as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses  Examples include a  Keep Off The Grass  sign  which derives its being from a bourgeois need but hinders the need of the masses for play and relaxation   Bad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events  like the  perfect moments  or  adventures  from   Nausea     By viewing one s ego as it once was rather than as it currently is  one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists  as illustrated by Anny in   Nausea        Part 3  Chapter 1  The look   The mere possible presence of another person causes one to look at him herself as an object  and see his her world as it appears to the other  This is not done from a specific location outside oneself  it is non positional  This is a recognition of the   subjectivity   in others    This transformation is most clear when one sees a   mannequin   that one confuses for a real person for a moment     While they are believing it is a person  their world is transformed  and everything exists as an object that partially escapes them  During this time the world comes on to you differently  and you can no longer have a total subjectivity  The world is now his world  a foreign world that no longer comes from you  but from him  The other person is a  threat to the order and arrangement of your whole world Your world is suddenly haunted by the Other s values  over which you have no control   ref name  earthlink    cite web  url

Being for Others  Love Masochism   Hate Sadism     Sartre states that many relationships are created by people s attraction not to another person but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them  This is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with  the look  of the other  The consequence is conflict  In order to keep the person s own being the person must control the other  but must control the freedom of the other  as freedom   These relationships are a profound manifestation of  bad faith  as the for itself is replaced with the other s freedom  The purpose of either participant is not to exist but to maintain the other participant s looking at them  This system is often mistakenly called love  but is in fact nothing more than emotional alienation and a denial of freedom through conflict with the other  Sartre believes that it is often created as a  means of making the unbearable anguish of a person s relationship to their    Facticity     all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited  such as birthplace and time  bearable   At its extreme  the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by  the look  and therefore radically missing their own freedoms  the participants can experience masochistic and sadistic attitudes  This happens when the participants cause pain to each other  in attempting to prove their control over the other s look  which they cannot escape because they believe themselves to be so enslaved to the look that experiencing their own subjectivity would be equally unbearable      Sex      Expert subject philosophy date

upon our purchase of it  There will be  for Sartre  no such moment of completion because  man is a useless passion  to be the   ens causa sui    the God of the   ontological proof        Nothingness      Confusing date December 2006   Sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists  for as long as we live  within an overall condition of nothingness    no thing ness    that ultimately allows for free consciousness   But simultaneously  within our  physical world    being    we are constrained to make continuous  conscious choices   It is this dichotomy that causes anguish  because choice  subjectivity  represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts   Subsequently  humans seek to flee our anguish through action oriented constructs such as escapes  visualizations or visions  dreams  designed to lead us toward some meaningful end  such as necessity  destiny  determinism  God   etc     Thus  in living our lives  we often become unconscious   actors   Bourgeois  Feminist  Worker  Party Member  Frenchman  Canadian or American each doing as we must to fulfill our chosen characters  destinies   But again  Sartre contends  our conscious choices  leading to often unconscious actions  run counter to our intellectual freedom   Yet we are bound to the conditioned  physical world in which some form of action is always required   This leads to   failed dreams of completion    as Sartre described them  because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all too constraining action  between the   being   and the   nothingness   that inherently coincide in our   self      Yet Sartre s recipe for   fulfillment   is to escape all quests by   completing   them  by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness  using terms such as the  spirit  or consciousness of mind  of seriousness  and describing the failure to do so in terms such as    Sartre and bad faith bad faith    and    false consciousness       Though Sartre s conclusion seems to be that being pales before nothingness  since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness  he contends that any person of a serious nature is   obligated   to continuous struggle between    a  the conscious desire for peaceful self fulfillment through physical actions and social roles as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself  see the gallery of Bouville s notables in   Nausea  book  Nausea     and  b  the more pure and raging spontaneity of   no thing   consciousness  of being instantaneously free to overturn one s roles  pull up stakes  and strike out new paths      Phenomenological ontology    In Sartre s opinion    consciousness   does not make sense by itself  It arises by the awareness of objects  So   consciousness of   is the proper way to qualify consciousness  One is always aware   of an object    The latter being   something   or   someone    it accounts to the same  This non positional quality of consciousness is what makes it an   ontology    And the fact that third parties are the   tangible   foundation for the intangible self is what truly makes it a   Phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenological   ontology  This section can be re stated in terms of essence and existence  The waiter  exists  and when he realizes his

3594|Beltrami identity|The    Beltrami identity    is an identity in the   calculus of variations    It says that a function   u   which is an extremal of the integral    math I u   int a b L x u u      dx  math   satisfies the differential equation    math   frac d  dx  left L u  frac  partial L   partial u   right   frac  partial L   partial x  0    math   In the case that L is the Lagrangian of a Mechanical system  and if L does not depend on x explicitly  which corresponds to a Lagrangian which does not explicitly depend on time  the Beltrami identity states that the Hamiltonian associated to the Lagrangian is a conserved energy       Proof     Define the conjugate momentum p to be the partial derivative of the function L with respect to u       math  p     partial L  over  partial u     math   The   Euler Lagrange equation   says     math   dp over dx      partial L  over  partial u    0   math   or     math  p      partial L  over  partial u    math   define the Hamiltonian H to be the   Legendre transformation Legendre transform   of L with respect to u      math  H   p u    L     math   Then      math  H     dH  over dx    p  u    p u       partial L  over  partial u   u       partial L  over  partial u  u      partial L  over  partial x   math   The second and third term cancel  by the definition of p  and the first and fourth terms cancel by the Euler Lagrange equation  This leaves  the Beltrami identity      math  H        partial L  over  partial x    math   which is a special case of   Noether s theorem        Application     In case that   L   is independent of   x    then the Beltrami identity states that H is constant     math    H     frac d  dx  left L u  frac  partial L   partial u   right    0  math   This can be used to solve the   Euler Lagrange equation    in the same way that conservation of energy can be used to solve Newton s law of motion  The condition that H is constant is an equation for the first derivative of u  while the original Euler Lagrange equation is an equation for the second derivative of u   For example  consider the   Brachistochrone problem    find the curve minimizing the integral      math   int 0 1   sqrt 1 y  2   over  sqrt y   dx   math   The quantity to minimize is the integral of an L which does not depend explicitly on time      math  L y y       sqrt 1 y  2   over  sqrt y     math   so the associated Hamiltonian is constant      math  H   p y    L    y  2  over  sqrt 1 y  2   sqrt y       sqrt 1 y  2  over  sqrt y       1  over  sqrt 1 y  2  sqrt y     math      math   sqrt 1 y  2  sqrt y     text constant   math   which simplifies to the differential equation for the cycloid     Category Calculus of variations       zh

3627|Berkeley RISC|   Berkeley RISC    was one of two seminal research projects into   RISC   based   microprocessor   design taking place under   ARPA   s   VLSI project    RISC was led by   David A  Patterson  scientist  David Patterson   at the   University of California  Berkeley   between 1980 and 1984  while the other was taking place only a short drive away at   Stanford University   under their   MIPS architecture MIPS   effort starting in 1981 and running until 1984  Berkeley s project was so successful that it became the name for all similar designs to follow  even the MIPS would become known as a  RISC processor   The RISC design was later commercialized as the   SPARC   processor     The RISC concept   Both RISC and MIPS were developed from the realization that the vast majority of programs did not use the vast majority of a processor s instructions  In one calculation it was found that the entire   Unix   system  when   compiler compiled    used only 30  of the available instructions on the   Motorola 68000    Much of the circuitry in the m68k  and similar designs  was dedicated to decoding these instructions which were never being used  The RISC idea was to include only those instructions that were   really   used  using those transistors to speed the system up instead   To do this  RISC concentrated on adding many more   Processor register registers    small bits of memory holding temporary values that can be accessed at zero cost  This contrasts with normal   main memory    which might take several cycles to access  By providing more registers  and making sure the compilers actually used them  programs should run much faster  Additionally the speed of the processor would be more closely defined by its clock speed  because less of its time would be spent waiting for memory accesses  Transistor for transistor  a RISC design would outperform a conventional CPU  hopefully by a lot   On the downside  the instructions being removed were generally performing several  sub instructions   For instance  the  code ADD  code  instruction of a traditional design would generally come in several flavours  one that added the numbers in two registers and placed it in a third  another that added numbers found in main memory and put the result in a register  etc  The RISC designs  on the other hand  included only a single flavour of any particular instruction  the  code ADD  code   for instance  would   always   use registers for all operands  This forced the programmer to write additional instructions to load the values from memory  if needed  making a RISC program  less dense    In the era of expensive memory this was a real concern  notably because memory was also much slower than the CPU  Since a RISC design s  code ADD  code  would actually require four instructions  two loads  an add  and a save   the machine would have to do much more memory access to read the extra instructions  potentially slowing it down considerably  This was offset to some degree by the fact that the new designs used what was then a very large instruction word of   32 bit  s  allowing small constants to be folded directly into the instruction instead of having to be loaded separately  Additionally  the results of one operation are often used soon after by another  so by skipping the write to memory and storing the result in a register  the program did not end up much larger  and could in theory run much faster  For instance  a string of instructions carrying out a series of mathematical operations might require only a few loads from memory  while the majority of the numbers being used are either loaded in the instructions themselves  or intermediate values in the registers   But to the casual observer  it was not clear whether or not the RISC concept would improve performance  or even make it worse  The only way to be sure was to actually simulate it  and in test after test  every simulation showed an enormous overall benefit in performance from this design   Where the two projects  RISC and MIPS  differed was in the handling of the registers  MIPS simply added lots of them and left it to the compilers to make use of them  RISC  on the other hand  added circuitry to the CPU to  help  the compiler  RISC used the concept of   register window  s  in which the entire  register file  was broken down into blocks  allowing the compiler to  see  one block for global variables  and another for local variables   The idea was to make one particularly common instruction  the   procedure call    extremely easy to implement in the compilers  Almost all   computer language  s use a system known as a   activation record   or   stack frame   that contains the address of who called it  the data that was passed in  and any results that need to be returned  In the vast majority of cases these frames are small  typically with three or less inputs and one or no outputs  In the Berkeley design  then  the entire procedure stack would most likely fit entirely within the register window   In this case the call into and return from a procedure is simple and extremely fast  A single instruction is called to set up a new block of registers  operands passed in on the  low end  of the new frame  and then the code jumps into the procedure  On return  the results are placed in the frame at the same end  and the code exits  The register windows are set up to overlap at the ends  meaning that the results from the call simply  appear  in the window of the code that called it    with no data having to be copied    Thus the common procedure call did not have to interact with main memory  greatly speeding it up   On the downside  this approach meant that procedures with large numbers of local variables were problematic  and ones with less led to registers  an expensive resource  being wasted  It was Stanford s work on compilers that led them to ignore the register window concept  believing that a smart compiler could make better use of the registers than a fixed system in hardware     RISC I    The first attempt to implement the RISC concept was originally known as    Gold     Work on the design started in 1980 as part of a VLSI design course  but the then complicated design crashed almost all existing design tools  The team had to spend considerable amounts of time improving or re writing the tools  and even with these new tools it took just under an hour to extract the design on a   VAX VAX 11 780     The final design  as    RISC I     was published   Association for Computing Machinery ACM   in 1981  It had 44 500 transistors implementing 31 instructions and a register file containing 78 32 bit registers  This allowed for six register windows containing 14 registers each  with an additional 18 globals  The control and instruction decode section occupied only 6  of the die  whereas the typical design of the era used about 50  for the same role  The register file took up most of that space   RISC I also featured a two stage   instruction pipeline   for additional speed  but without the complex instruction re ordering of more modern designs  This makes conditional branches a problem  because the compiler has to fill the instruction following a conditional branch  the so called    branch delay slot       with something selected to be  safe   i e   not dependent on the outcome of the conditional   Sometimes the only suitable instruction in this case is  code   NOP    code   A notable number of later RISC style designs still require the consideration of branch delay   After a month of validation and debugging  the design was sent to the innovative   MOSIS     Foundry  electronics  fab   for production on June 22  1981  using a 2  m  2 000 nm  process  A variety of delays forced them to abandon their masks four separate times  and wafers with working examples did not arrive back at Berkeley until May 1982  The first working RISC I  computer   actually a checkout board  ran on June 11th  In testing  the chips proved to have lesser performance than expected  In general  an instruction would take 2  s to complete  while the original design allotted for about 400 ns  five times as fast   The precise reasons for this problem were never fully explained  However  throughout testing it was clear that certain instructions did run at the expected speed  suggesting the problem was physical  not logical   Had the design worked at full speed  performance would have been excellent  Simulations using a variety of small programs compared the 4 MHz RISC I to the 5 MHz   32 bit     VAX VAX 11 780   and the 5 MHz   16 bit     Zilog Z8000   showed this clearly  Program size was about 30  larger than the VAX but very close to that of the Z8000  validating the argument that the higher   code density   of CISC designs was not actually all that impressive in reality  In terms of overall performance  the RISC I was twice as fast as the VAX  and about four times that of the Z8000  More interestingly  the programs ended up performing about the same overall amount of memory access because the large register file dramatically improved the odds the needed operand was already on chip   It is important to put this performance in context  Even though the RISC design had run slower than the VAX  it made no difference to the importance of the design  RISC allowed for the production of a true 32 bit processor on a real chip die using what was already an older fab  Traditional designs simply could not do this  with so much of the chip surface dedicated to decoder logic  a true 32 bit design like the   Motorola 68020   required newer fabs before becoming practical  Using the same fabs  RISC I could have largely outperformed the competition     RISC II    While the RISC I design ran into delays  work at Berkeley had already turned to the new    Blue    design  Work on Blue progressed slower than Gold  due both to the lack of a pressing need now that Gold was going to fab  as well as changeovers in the classes and students staffing the effort  This pace also allowed them to add in several new features that would end up improving the design considerably   The key difference was a simpler cache circuitry that eliminated one line per bit  from three to two   dramatically shrinking the register file size  The change also required much tighter bus timing  but this was a small price to pay and in order to meet the needs several other parts of the design were sped up as well   The savings due to the new design were tremendous  Whereas Gold contained a total of 78 registers in 6 windows  Blue contained 138 registers broken into 8 windows of 16 registers each  with another 10 globals  This expansion of the register file increases the chance that a given procedure can fit all of its local storage in registers  as well as increasing the nesting depth  Nevertheless the larger register file used up less transistors  and the final Blue design  fabed as    RISC II     implemented all of the RISC instruction set with only 39 000 transistors   The other major change was to include an  instruction format expander   which invisibly  up converted  16 bit instructions into a 32 bit format  This allowed smaller instructions  typically things with one or no operands  like  code NOP  code   to be stored in memory in a smaller 16 bit format and stuff two such instructions into a single machine word  The instructions would be invisibly expanded back to 32 bit versions before they reached the   Arithmetic logic unit ALU    meaning that no changes were needed in the core logic  This simple technique yielded a surprising 30  improvement in code density  making an otherwise identical program on Blue run faster than on Gold due to the decreased number of memory accesses   RISC II proved to be much more successful in silicon  and entered testing  outperforming almost all minicomputers on almost all tasks  For instance  performance ranged from 85  of VAX speed to 256  on a variety of loads  that is  the RISC II often outperformed the VAX by   two times    RISC II was also benched against the famous   Motorola 68000    then considered to be the best commercial chip implementation  and outperformed it by 140  to 420     Follow ons    Work on the original RISC designs ended with RISC II  but the concept itself lived on at Berkeley  The basic core was re used in    SOAR    in 1984  basically a RISC converted to run   Smalltalk    in the same way that it could be claimed RISC ran C   and later in the similar    VLSI BAM    that ran   PROLOG   instead of Smalltalk  Another effort was    SPUR     which was a full set of chips needed to build a complete 32 bit   workstation     RISC is less famous  but more influential  for being the basis of the commercial   SPARC   processor design from   Sun Microsystems    It was the SPARC that first clearly demonstrated the power of the RISC concept  when they shipped in the first   SPARCstation  s they outperformed anything on the market  This led to virtually every   Unix   vendor hurrying for a RISC design of their own  leading to designs like the   DEC Alpha   and   PA RISC family PA RISC    while   Silicon Graphics SGI   purchased   MIPS Computer Systems    By 1986 most large chip vendors followed  working on efforts like the   Motorola 88000      Fairchild Clipper      AMD 29000   and the   PowerPC     Techniques developed for and alongside the idea of the reduced instruction set have also been adopted in successively more powerful implementations and extensions of the traditional  complex    x86 architecture    Much of a modern microprocessor s transistor count is devoted to large caches  many   instruction pipeline pipeline   stages    superscalar   instruction dispatch    branch predictor branch prediction   and other modern techniques which are applicable regardless of instruction architecture  The amount of silicon dedicated to instruction decoding on a modern x86 implementation is proportionately quite small  so the distinction between  complex  and RISC processor implementations has become blurred     References      http   www eecs

3657|Bertrand competition|   Bertrand competition    is a model of   competition   used in   economics    named after   Joseph Louis Fran ois Bertrand    1822 1900    It describes interactions among firms  sellers  that set prices and their customers  buyers  that choose quantities at that price    The model rests on the following assumptions     There are at least two firms producing   wiktionary Homogeneous homogeneous    undifferentiated  products     Firms do not cooperate    Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously     Consumers buy everything from a firm with a lower price  If all firms charge the same price  consumers randomly select among them      Calculating the classic Bertrand model     MC   Marginal cost  p sub 1  sub    firm 1 s price level  p sub 2  sub    firm 2 s price level  p sub M  sub    monopoly price level    Firm 1 s optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices  Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand  D   though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits  In general terms  firm 1 s   best response   function is p sub 1  sub    p sub 2  sub    this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2     Diagram 1 shows firm 1 s reaction function p sub 1  sub    p sub 2  sub    with each firm s strategy on each axis  It shows that when P sub 2  sub  is less than marginal cost  firm 2 pricing below MC  firm 1 prices at marginal cost  p sub 1  sub  MC  When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices  then firm 1 prices just below firm 2  When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices  P sup M  sup   firm 1 prices at monopoly level  p sub 1  sub  p sup M  sup      Image economics bertrand diag1 png     Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1  its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line  Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions     Image economics bertrand diag2 png     The result of the firms  strategies is a   Nash equilibrium    that is  a pair of strategies  prices in this case  where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price  This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves  Point N on the diagram  At this point p sub 1  sub  p sub 1  sub    p sub 2  sub    and p sub 2  sub  p sub 2  sub    p sub 1  sub    As you can see  point N on the diagram is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost   Another way of thinking about it  a simpler way  is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost  firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price  However  by lowering prices just slightly  a firm could gain the whole market  so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can  It would be irrational to price below marginal cost  because the firm would make a loss  Therefore  both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit      Implications      Note that   collusion colluding   to charge the   monopoly   price and supplying one half of the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up  However not colluding and charging   marginal cost    which is the non cooperative outcome is the only   Nash equilibrium   of this model     If one firm has lower average cost  a superior   production function production technology     it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one  i e  a price   just   below the lowest price the other firm can manage  and take all the business  This is known as   limit price  limit pricing        Bertrand competition versus   Cournot competition       Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level  a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under perfect competition     Neither model is necessarily  better   The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry  depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation     If capacity and output can be easily changed  Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition  Or  if output and capacity are difficult to adjust  then Cournot is generally a better model     Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two stage model  where in the first stage firms choose capacities  and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion      Critical analysis of the Bertrand model      The classic Bertrand model assumes firms compete purely on price  ignoring non price competition  Firms can   product differentiation differentiate   their products and charge a higher price  For example  would someone travel twice as far to save 1  on the price of their vegetables  The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result   that price is driven down to marginal cost   no longer holds     The model ignores capacity constraints  If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the  price equals marginal cost  result may not hold     The classical model only focuses on the pure strategy Nash equilibrium  There are mixed strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits  see Kaplan   Wettstein  2000  and Baye   Morgan  1999      The classical model ignores search cost of consumers  If the consumer does not know the price of the product before visiting a firm and each visit is costly  however small   then a Nash equilibrium price will not arise  This creates the possibility that firms will randomly price at some point between marginal cost and the monopoly price      See also        Cournot competition       Differentiated Bertrand competition       Stackelberg competition

3658|Bertrand paradox  economics |  For other paradoxes by Joseph Bertrand Bertrand s paradox  disambiguation    In economics and commerce  the    Bertrand paradox    ndash  named after its creator    Joseph Bertrand   ndash describes a situation in which two players  firms  reach a state of   Nash equilibrium   where both firms charge a price equal to marginal cost  The paradox is that in reality  it usually takes a large number of firms to ensure that prices equal marginal cost  Typically  a small number of firms  oligopoly  earn positive profits by charging prices above cost  Suppose two firms  A and B  sell an identical   commodity    each with the same cost of   Economic production production   and   Distribution  business  distribution    so that customers choose the product solely on the basis of price   It follows that neither A nor B will set a higher price than the other because doing so would yield the entire market to their rival  If they set the same price  the companies will share both the market and profits    On the other hand  if either firm were to lower its price  even a little  it would gain the whole market and substantially larger profits  Since both A and B know this  they will each try to undercut their competitor until the product is selling at zero economic profit  This is the pure strategy   Nash equilibrium    Recent work has shown that there may be an additional mixed strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits  see Kaplan   Wettstein  2000  and Baye   Morgan  1999    The Bertrand paradox rarely appears in practice because real products are almost always   product differentiation differentiated   in some way other than price    brand name    if nothing else   firms have limitations on their capacity to manufacture and distribute  and two firms rarely have identical costs   Bertrand s result is paradoxical because if the number of firms goes from one to two  the price decreases from the   monopoly   price to the   Competition Economics and business competitive   price and stays at the same level as the number of firms increases further   This is not very realistic  as in reality  markets featuring a small number of firms with market power typically charge a price in excess of marginal cost   The empirical analysis shows that in most industries with two competitors  positive profits are made  Solutions to the Paradox attempt to derive solutions that are more in line with solutions from the   Cournot competition Cournot model   of competition  where two firms in a market earn positive profits that lie somewhere between the perfectly competitive and monopoly levels    Some reasons the Bertrand paradox do not strictly apply       Capacity constraints   ndash Sometimes firms do not have enough capacity to satisfy all demand     Product differentiation   ndash If products of different firms are differentiated  then consumers may not switch completely to the product with lower price     Dynamic competition   ndash Repeated interaction or repeated price competition can lead to the price above MC in equilibrium      More money for higher price   ndash It follows from repeated interaction  If one company sets their price slightly higher  then they will still get about the same amount of buys but more profit for each buy  so the other company will raise their price  and so on  only in repeated games  otherwise the price dynamics are in the other direction       Oligopoly   If the two companies can agree on a price  it is in their long term interest to keep the agreement  the revenue from cutting prices is less than twice the revenue from keeping the agreement  and lasts only until the other firm cuts its own prices     See also      Joseph Bertrand      Bertrand model      Differentiated Bertrand competition      Edgeworth paradox      Prisoner s dilemma      References      Baye  M R  and J  Morgan  1997   Necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of Bertrand paradox outcomes  Princeton Woodrow Wilson School  Discussion Paper in Economics  186     Baye  M R  and J  Morgan  1999   A folk theorem for one shot Bertrand games   Economics Letters  65 1  59 65     Bertrand  J   1883   Book review of theorie mathematique de la richesse sociale and of recherches sur les principles mathematiques de la theorie des richesses   Journal des Savants 67  499 508     Kaplan  T R  and D  Wettstein  1997   Mixed strategy equilibria with constant returns to scale technology   Monaster Center Discussion Paper 97 4     http   www springerlink com content wuu31dtnc7d6rpty  Kaplan  T R  and D  Wettstein    2000   The Possibility of Mixed Strategy Equilibria with Constant Returns to Scale Technology under Bertrand Competition   Spanish Economic Review  2 1  65 71     game theory      Category Economics paradoxes     Category Game theory      ru                                   uk                                
3669|Beta BASIC|  Unreferenced date May 2010      Beta BASIC    was a   BASIC programming language BASIC     Interpreter  computing  interpreter   for the   Sinclair Research     ZX Spectrum     microcomputer    written by Dr Andy Wright and sold by his one man software house BetaSoft  BetaSoft also produced a regular newsletter magazine  BetaNews  which was one of the main fora of the time for advanced Spectrum BASIC programmers   Originally it started as a   BASIC toolkit   but over time it grew into an interpreter in its own right     Image Screenshot betabasic 31 png right Screenshot of BetaBasic in operation       Operation    It ran as a   terminate and stay resident   program  completely replacing   Sinclair BASIC    As with most micros of the 1980s  the Spectrum s BASIC interpreter was also its operating system  providing the   command line interface    CLI   the on screen program   text editor editor   and everything else  It was the sole means of operating and controlling the computer      Facilities    Beta BASIC provided a new and improved CLI and editor  It supported Sinclair s idiosyncratic single key entry system for BASIC keywords but also allowed keywords to be spelled out letter for letter  which was quicker if the user had fitted a full size full travel keyboard to their machine  a very popular modification for serious users  This also removed the necessity for memorising the sometimes arcane key combinations necessary to enter less commonly used BASIC keywords   However  the single key entry system was also extended by mapping the Spectrum s  graphics  characters to Beta BASIC s new keywords   To switch from keyword entry to typed entry  it was merely necessary to type a single space  causing the cursor mode to change from K  keyword  to L  lowercase  or C  capital     The KEYWORDS statement could also be used to alter this behaviour  for example by disabling the K mode    This was a much simpler  more elegant   less intrusive change than Sinclair s own full screen editor for the Spectrum 128   Another nicety was that the editor  when listing  could optionally automatically   prettyprint   code  It was possible to do this manually in Sinclair BASIC  but automatic indentation has the advantage of highlighting certain types of coding error   primarily those to do with failing to correctly close constructs  Other editing improvements included automatic highlighting of the current line indicator   a small tweak but disproportionately helpful   and the ability to move the cursor up and down as well as left and right  a huge boon when editing long lines  Combined with the 64 column display  see  New functionality  section below   these improvements made Beta BASIC a much more productive environment even for coding standard Sinclair BASIC and making no use of BetaSoft s language additions   Beta BASIC was also a BASIC interpreter in its own right  completely replacing and bypassing the Spectrum   Read only memory ROM    which it used as a library  It occasionally made calls into the ROM to access useful functions which it was not worth re implementing in Beta BASIC itself  either because the ROM routines were good enough or for reasons of space   Beta BASIC had to run in the meagre 48   kilobyte KB   of memory available on a Spectrum and still leave room for the user s code      Language changes    For its time  Beta BASIC was astonishingly sophisticated  It provided full   structured programming   with named procedures and functions  complete with local variables  allowing for programming using   recursion    Although it supported line numbers  they were not necessary and it offered a mode of operation which completely suppressed the display of line numbers  It provided array operations and commands for accessing files on tape and disk   In terms of facilities  it exceeded many other available 8 bit BASICs of the 1980s and in some ways approached the capabilities of   Microsoft   s   QuickBASIC   4 5 compiler or   QBASIC   interpreter  which were programs for far more sophisticated 16 bit computers a decade later   On the 128K Spectrum machines  Beta BASIC provided extended facilities allowing programmers to access the machine s extra memory  which took the form of a   RAM disk    As well as allowing the programmer to save and load programs  blocks of memory or screen images into the RAM disc and catalogue the contents of the RAM disk  Beta BASIC also provided commands for the creation and use of   Array data structure arrays   held in the RAM disk  allowing programs running in the 30 KB or so of free memory on the Spectrum to manipulate arrays of approaching 80 KB   a very significant extra amount of space by 1980s standards and more than almost any other 8 bit BASIC  which were generally limited to 64 KB of program and data combined      New functionality    Beta BASIC also drove the Spectrum s 256x192   pixel   display directly  eliminating the restrictions of the ROM s 32 column text display  Beta BASIC offered scalable screen fonts  with a special soft font which was only 4 pixels wide but still highly legible  This meant that Beta BASIC could display 64 columns of text across the screen  quite competitive with newer 8 bit machines  80 column screens  If the user was prepared to tolerate characters being displayed without gaps between them  an 85 column display was possible  This was not very readable but did allow easy porting of BASIC applications designed for an 80 column screen  Text size could be controlled programmatically so that part of a program s display might use 64 column text  part 32 column text and enlarged or reduced intermediate sizes   Special versions were produced for users of   Interface 1   and the   ZX Microdrive    and subsequently for those with the   DISCiPLE   and   PlusD   disk interfaces as well  A version for the   Amstrad   Spectrum  3 was also under consideration for a while  but Dr  Wright discarded the project      Limitations    Nonetheless  Beta BASIC suffered from some limitations  As with other 8 bit microprocessors  the Spectrum could only address 64 KB of contiguous memory due to the addressing restrictions of the Spectrum s   Zilog Z80     CPU    Of this  16 KB was taken by the Sinclair BASIC ROM  leaving 48 KB for RAM  The screen took some of this  as did the areas used for holding the interpreter s own internal data structures  Beta BASIC took around 11 12 KB of the remainder  in some cases leaving only 20 KB or so for user programs   The replacement of Sinclair s editor meant that it was not possible to use the 128K Spectrum ROM s full screen BASIC editor  No   compiler   was available for Beta BASIC code and existing Sinclair BASIC compilers such as   HiSoft   BASIC could not handle the extended keywords and facilities of Beta BASIC  It was possible to develop under Beta BASIC and later compile with HiSoft BASIC  but only by restricting oneself to the limited subset of Sinclair BASIC supported by both implementations   a very frustrating experience for a Beta BASIC coder   Because Spectrum BASIC only supported   floating point   variables and arithmetic  there was no support for   Integer  computer science  integer   work   neither did Beta BASIC  This was unfortunate  as this provided significant speed gains and memory savings in rival BASICs  Another remaining Sinclair BASIC limitation was that only single letter variable names could be used for strings  arrays and other types   The only other 8 bit BASIC with inbuilt support for structured programming was   BBC BASIC    Beta BASIC named procedures did not need to be called with the PROC keyword like in BBC BASIC and thus became new language keywords  allowing the language to be extended in itself  However  BBC BASIC was considerably quicker   the fastest BASIC interpreter of the time  Beta BASIC was not especially fast  though it included faster replacements for particularly slow ROM routines  such as the circle and arc drawing code  Another BBC BASIC feature it lacked was support for the inclusion of inline assembly language in BASIC programs      Subsequent development    During the development of their sophisticated new successor to the Spectrum  the   SAM Coup     Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon of   MGT   approached BetaSoft and contracted Dr Wright to provide the BASIC for the new machine  He provided a complete BASIC interpreter which drew extensively upon Beta BASIC but was differently structured  as this was a language in its own right and had no Sinclair ROM to call upon or work around    SAM BASIC   was largely compatible with Beta BASIC and operated in a very similar manner  except for areas where the SAM hardware was significantly different  such as the SAM s screen and extended memory  BetaSoft later released an extension to SAM BASIC  named MasterBASIC  http   www worldofsam org node 202      BASIC

3700|Biased graph|In   mathematics    a    biased graph    is a   graph theory graph   with a list of distinguished circles  edge sets of   simple cycle  s   such that if two circles in the list are contained in a   glossary of graph theory theta graph    then so is the third circle of the theta graph   A biased graph is a generalization of the combinatorial essentials of a   gain graph   and in particular of a   signed graph     Formally  a    biased graph      is a pair    G         B       where      B      is a    linear class    of circles  this by definition is a class of circles that satisfies the theta graph property mentioned above   A   subgraph   or edge set whose circles are all in      B       and which contains no   Graph  mathematics  half edges    is called    balanced      For instance  a circle belonging to      B      is   balanced   and one that does not belong to      B      is   unbalanced     Biased graphs are interesting mostly because of their   matroid  s  but also because of their connection with multiary   quasigroups     See below     Technical notes    A biased graph may have   Graph  mathematics  half edges    one endpoint  and   Graph  mathematics  loose edges    no endpoints    The edges with two endpoints are of two kinds  a link has two distinct endpoints  while a loop has two coinciding endpoints   Linear classes of circles are a special case of linear subclasses of circuits in a   matroid       Examples      If every circle belongs to      B       and there are no half edges    is balanced   A balanced biased graph is  for most purposes  essentially the same as an ordinary graph     If      B      is empty    is called    contrabalanced      Contrabalanced biased graphs are related to   bicircular matroid  s     If      B      consists of the circles of odd length    is called    antibalanced    and is the biased graph obtained from an all negative   signed graph       The linear class      B      is    additive     that is  closed under set sum  for sums that give a circle     if and only if        B      is the class of positive circles of a signed graph       may consist of a cycle of length   n     3 with all edge doubled and such that no   digon    circle of length 2  is balanced   Call this a    biased 2  C sub n  sub          Such biased graphs lead to spikes and swirls  see Matroids  below      Some kinds of biased graph are obtained from   gain graph  s or are generalizations of special kinds of gain graphs   The latter include    biased expansion graphs     which generalize   gain graph group expansion graph  s     Minors    A   Minor  graph theory  minor   of a biased graph        G         B       is the result of any sequence of taking subgraphs and contracting edge sets   For biased graphs  as for graphs  it suffices to take a subgraph  which may be the whole graph  and then contract an edge set  which may be the empty set    A    subgraph    of   consists of a subgraph   H   of the underlying graph   G    with balanced circle class consisting of those balanced circles that are in   H     The    deletion    of an edge set   S    written    minus    S    is the subgraph with all vertices and all edges except those of   S        Contraction    of   is relatively complicated   To contract one edge   e    the procedure depends on the kind of edge   e   is   If   e   is a link  contract it in   G     A circle   C   in the contraction   G     e   is balanced if either   C   or  math C  cup e  math  is a balanced circle of   G      If   e   is a balanced loop or a loose edge  it is simply deleted   If it is an unbalanced loop or a half edge  it and its vertex   v   are deleted  each other edge with   v   as an endpoint loses that endpoint  so a link with   v   as one endpoint becomes a half edge at its other endpoint  while a loop or half edge at   v   becomes a loose edge   In the contraction     S   by an arbitrary edge set   S    the edge set is   E    minus    S      We let   G        V      E       The vertex set is the class of vertex sets of balanced components of the subgraph    V      S    of     That is  if    V      S    has balanced components with vertex sets   V   sub 1  sub          V   sub   k    sub   then     S   has   k   vertices   V   sub 1  sub          V   sub   k    sub     An edge   e   of    not in   S    becomes an edge of     S   and each endpoint   v   sub   i    sub  of   e   in   that belongs to some   V sub i  sub    becomes the endpoint   V sub i  sub    of   e   in     S     thus  an endpoint of   e   that is not in a balanced component of    V      S    disappears   An edge with all endpoints in unbalanced components of    V      S    becomes a loose edge in the contraction   An edge with only one endpoint in a balanced component of    V      S    becomes a half edge   An edge with two endpoints that belong to different balanced components becomes a link  and an edge with two endpoints that belong to the same balanced component becomes a loop     Matroids    There are two   matroid  s associated with a biased graph  both of which generalize the cycle matroid of a graph  Zaslavsky  1991       The frame matroid     The    frame matroid     sometimes called    bias matroid     of a biased graph    M        Zaslavsky  1989  has for its ground set the edge set   E     An edge set is independent if each component contains either no circles or just one circle  which is unbalanced    In matroid theory a half edge acts like an unbalanced loop and a loose edge acts like a balanced loop      M      is a frame matroid in the abstract sense  meaning that it s a submatroid of a matroid in which  for at least one basis  the set of lines generated by pairs of basis elements covers the whole matroid  Conversely  every abstract frame matroid is the frame matroid of some biased graph   There are four kinds of circuit of the matroid  they are called    frame circuits    or    bias circuits      One is a balanced circle   Two other kinds are a pair of unbalanced circles together with a connecting simple path  such that the two circles are either disjoint  then the connecting path has one end in common with each circle and is otherwise disjoint from both  or share just a single common vertex  in this case the connecting path is that single vertex    The fourth kind of circuit is a theta graph in which every circle is unbalanced     The rank of an edge set   S   is   n    minus    b    where   n   is the number of vertices of   G   and   b   is the number of balanced components of   S    counting isolated vertices as balanced components   Minors of the frame matroid agree with minors of the biased graph  that is    M     minus   S        M      minus   S   and   M       S        M        S     Frame matroids generalize the   Dowling geometry Dowling geometries   associated with a group  Dowling  1973    The frame matroid of a 2  C   sub   n    sub  is called a    swirl      It is important in matroid structure theory      The lift matroid     The    extended lift matroid      L   sub 0  sub    G    has for its ground set the set   E   sub 0  sub  the union of   E   with an    extra point     which we denote   e   sub 0  sub    The    lift matroid      L     G    is the extended lift matroid restricted to   E     The extra point acts exactly like an unbalanced loop or a half edge  so we describe only the lift matroid   An edge set is independent if it contains either no circles or just one circle  which is unbalanced    This is the rule that is applied separately to each component in the frame matroid      A matroid circuit is a balanced circle  a pair of unbalanced circles that are either disjoint or have just a common vertex  or a theta graph whose circles are all unbalanced     The rank of an edge set   S   is   n    minus    c        where   c   is the number of components of   S    counting isolated vertices  and   is 0 if   S   is balanced and 1 if it is not   Minors of the lift and extended lift matroids agree in part with minors of the biased graph   Deletions agree    L     minus   S        L      minus   S     Contractions agree only for balanced edge sets    M       S        M        S   if   S   is balanced  but not if it is unbalanced   The lift matroid of a 2  C   sub   n    sub  is called a    spike      Spikes seem to be quite important in matroid structure theory     Multiary quasigroups    Just as a group expansion of a complete graph   K   sub   n    sub  encodes the group  see   Dowling geometry     its combinatorial analog expanding a simple cycle of length   n     1 encodes an   n   ary  multiary    Quasigroup Polyadic or multiary quasigroups quasigroup     It is possible to prove theorems about multiary

3730|Bidirectional scattering distribution function|The definition of the    BSDF        Bidirectional scattering distribution function     is not well standardized  The term was probably introduced in 1991 by   Paul Heckbert    Ref endnote veach1997 a    Most often it is used to name the general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface  However in practice this phenomenon is usually split into the reflected and transmitted components  which are then treated separately as    BRDF          Bidirectional reflectance distribution function       and    BTDF        Bidirectional transmittance distribution function         Image BSDF05 800 png thumb right 280px BSDF  BRDF   BTDF         BSDF    is a superset and the generalization of the    BRDF    and    BTDF     The concept behind all BxDF functions could be described as a black box with the inputs being any two angles  one for incoming  incident  ray and the second one for the outgoing  reflected or transmitted  ray at a given point of the surface  The output of this black box is the value defining the ratio between the incoming and the outgoing light energy for the given couple of angles  The content of the black box may be a mathematical formula which more or less accurately tries to model and approximate the actual surface behavior or an algorithm which produces the output based on discrete samples of measured data  This implies that the function is 4   1  dimensional  4 values for 2 3D angles   1 optional for wave length of the light   which means that it cannot be simply represented by 2D and not even by a 3D graph  Each 2D or 3D graph  sometimes seen in the literature  shows only a slice of the function     Some tend to use the term    BSDF    simply as a category name covering the whole family of BxDF functions     The term    BSDF    is sometimes used in a slightly different context  for the function describing the amount of the scatter  not scattered light   scatter being simply a function of the incident light angle  An example to illustrate this context  for perfectly lambertian surface the BSDF angle  const  This approach is used for instance to verify the output quality by the manufacturers of the glossy surfaces     Another recent usage of the term    BSDF    can be seen in some 3D packages  when vendors use it as a  smart  category to encompass the simple well known cg algorithms like Phong  Blinn etc     Overview of the BxDF functions     Image BSSDF01 400 svg thumb right 250px BRDF vs  BSSRDF       BSDF        Bidirectional scattering distribution function     is the most general function      BSSRDF        Bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution function    or    B scattering surface RDF      Ref nicodemus 1977  describes the relation between outgoing radiance and the incident flux  including the phenomena like   subsurface scattering    SSS       BRDF          Bidirectional reflectance distribution function       is a simplified BSSRDF  assuming that light enters and leaves at the same point    see the image on the right          BTDF        Bidirectional transmittance distribution function     is similar to  BRDF but for the opposite side of the surface     see the top image        See also     Portal Computer graphics      Bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF      Subsurface scattering      Radiometry      Reflectance      Radiance      Bidirectional texture function BTF      References     Reflist       note  endnote veach1997 a   Eric Veach  1997      http   graphics stanford edu papers veach thesis thesis bw pdf  Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation       http   graphics stanford edu papers veach thesis chapter3 ps page 86  br citing   Paul Heckbert  1991    Simulating Global Illumination Using Adaptive Meshing   PhD thesis    University of California  Berkeley  page 26     note  endnote rauw   Randall Rauwendaal   http   graphics cs ucdavis edu  bcbudge ecs298 2004 General BSDFs BSSDFs ppt  Rendering General BSDFs and BSSDFs        note  nicodemus 1977   The original definition in Nicodemus et al  1977 has   scattering surface    but somewhere along the way  the word ordering was reversed     External links      Category Radiometry       NB  Usage of term  photometry  varies between astronomy and optics  The categories are named following the optics convention      Category Astrophysics     Category Computer graphics      zh

3793|Billiard ball computer|  File Toffoli BilliardBall gif thumb 400px   Fredkin gate Fredkin   and   Toffoli Gate   Billiard Ball Model    A    billiard ball computer     also known as a    conservative logic circuit     is an idealized model of a computing machine based on   newtonian dynamics    Instead of using electronic signals like a conventional   Von Neumann machine computer    it relies on the motion of spherical billiard balls in a friction free environment made of buffers against which the balls bounce perfectly  It was devised to investigate the relation between computation and   reversible process  es in physics  and to provide context to the   Halting problem   and similar results in computability theory  A paradox seems to arise as a consequence of the existence of this ideal machine  since it shows that there exists no algorithm to predict whether the arbitrary billiard ball system provides an  output  for any given  input   This leads to an unexpected  ref whew   conclusion  the question whether a given  moving  object can reach a given position is   Decidability  logic  undecidable   under the rules of the Newtonian dynamics   ref adam    The    billiard ball model    was proposed in 1982 in a seminal paper  ref bb   of   Edward Fredkin   and   Tommaso Toffoli    The work on this and similar models was continued by the MIT Information Mechanics group and has strong relations with the present Amorphous computing group at MIT or the Quantum Mechanical Hamiltonian Model of Paul Beniof  Presently there are a few research lines related to these kind of models in what it is known as   unconventional computing     When the number of objects  such as billiard balls  in a system becomes large  we need new principles like the entropy or temperature  ref unc   relations  And when the multitude of particles are able to react and change  not only in position and momentum  then new behaviours arise  The   Amorphous computing   paradigm prepares the engineering principles to observe  control  organize  and exploit the coherent and cooperative behaviour of programmable multitudes   The unconventional  ref unc    ref im   and   biologically inspired computing   paradigms use asynchronous and decentralized agents and include the model of cellular automata  Recent works related to the billiard ball model are the particle based model  ref part    ref partb    ref partc    and the reaction and diffusion of chemical species   ref gray       See also        Analog computer       Biologically inspired computing       Chemical computer       Mechanical computer       Quantum computing       Reversible computing       Unconventional computing       References        note whew   Whewell  William   http   books google com books id j6lAAAAAIAAJ pg PA274  The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences    vol 2  London  John W  Parker  1847  pp  274 295     note adam   Adamatzky  Andrew  Ed    http   books google com books isbn 1852335408  Collision based Computing    Springer  2002     note bb   Fredkin  Edward and Toffoli  Tomasso    http   calculemus org logsoc03 materialy ConservativeLogic pdf Conservative Logic    Int  J  Theor  Phys  21  1982   219 253   Describes the Billiard Ball model      note unc   Unconventional computation Conference 2007   http   cnls lanl gov uc07      note im   Information Mechanics and Unconventional computating  http   www interquanta biz im      note part    Particle based Methodology for Representing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks   InterSense 2006 Conference Nice  http   portal acm org ft gateway cfm id 1142685 type pdf coll GUIDE dl  CFID 15151515 CFTOKEN 6184618 ACM Press New York      note partb    Special issue on particle based modelling methods applied in biology    http   portal acm org toc cfm id 379912 coll GUIDE dl  acm type issue CFID 15151515 CFTOKEN 6184618    Issue 7 May 2001  ACM      note partc    Physics Based Models to Support Test and Evaluation  S  Blankenship   F  Mello  High Performance Computing Workshop 1998  http   www dtc army mil hpcw 1998 blanken blanken html     note gray   the Gray Scott model of a chemical reaction  http   www swiss ai mit edu projects amorphous GrayScott     Category Computational models     Category Mechanical computers      ja                  
3799|Bin  computational geometry |  Context date October 2009     Unreferenced date October 2007     Image bin computational geometry png thumb right 400px The bin data structure    In   computational geometry    the    bin      data structure   allows efficient region queries  i e   if there are some   Cartesian Coordinate System axis   aligned rectangles on a 2D   Plane  geometry  plane    answer the question   Given a query rectangle  return all rectangles intersecting it      kd tree   is another data structure that can answer this question efficiently  In the example in the figure    A  B  C  D  E    and   F   are existing rectangles  the query with the rectangle   Q   should return   C  D  E   and   F    if we define all rectangles as   closed interval  s   The data structure partitions a region of the 2D plane into uniform sized   bins    The bounding box of the bins encloses all   candidate   rectangles to be queried  All the bins are arranged in a 2D array  All the candidates are represented also as 2D arrays  The size of a candidate s array is the number of bins it intersects  For example  in the figure  candidate   B   has 6 elements arranged in a 3 row by 2 column array because it intersects 6 bins in such an arrangement  Each bin contains the head of a   singly linked list    If a candidate intersects a bin  it is chained to the bin s linked list  Each element in a candidate s array is a link node in the corresponding bin s linked list      Operations        Query     From the query rectangle   Q    we can find out which bin its lower left corner intersects efficiently by simply subtracting the bin s bounding box s lower left corner from the lower left corner of   Q   and dividing the result by the width and height of a bin respectively  We then iterate the bins   Q   intersects and examine all the candidates in the linked lists of these bins  For each candidate we check if it does indeed intersect   Q    If so and it is not previously reported  then we report it  We can use the convention that we only report a candidate the first time we find it  This can be done easily by clipping the candidate against the query rectangle and comparing its lower left corner against the current location  If it is a match then we report  otherwise we skip       Insertion and deletion     Insertion is linear to the number of bins a candidate intersects because inserting a candidate into 1 bin is constant time  Deletion is more expensive because we need to search the singly linked list of each bin the candidate intersects   In a multithread environment  insert  delete and query are mutually exclusive  However  instead of locking the whole data structure  a sub range of bins may be locked  Detailed performance analysis should be done to justify the overhead      Efficiency and tuning    The analysis is similar to a   hash table    The worst case scenario is that all candidates are concentrated in one bin  Then query is O   n     delete is O   n     and insert is O 1   where   n   is the number of candidates  If the candidates are evenly spaced so that each bin has a constant number of candidates  The query is O   k    where   k   is the number of bins the query rectangle intersects  Insert and delete are O   m    where   m   is the number of bins the inserting candidate intersects  In practice delete is much slower than insert   Like a hash table  bin s efficiency depends a lot on the distribution of both location and size of candidates and queries  In general  the smaller the query rectangle  the more efficient the query  The bin s size should be such that it contains as few candidates as possible but large enough so that candidates do not span too many bins  If a candidate span many bins  a query has to skip this candidate over and over again after it is reported at the first bin of intersection  For example  in the figure    E   is visited 4 times in the query of   Q   and so has to be skipped 3 times   To further speed up the query  divisions can be replaced by   right shift  s  This requires the number of bins along an axis direction to be an exponent of 2      Compared to other range query data structures     Against   kd tree    the bin structure allows efficient insertion and deletion without the complexity of rebalancing  This can be very useful in algorithms that need to incrementally add shapes to the search data structure      See also         kd tree   is another efficient range query data structure      Space partitioning      Category Geometric algorithms

built using   binary adder  s   A variety of    Category computer arithmetic computer arithmetic   techniques can be used to implement a digital multiplier   Most techniques involve computing a set of   partial products    and then summing the partial products together   This process is similar to the method taught to primary schoolchildren for conducting long multiplication on base 10 integers  but has been modified here for application to a base 2    binary numeral system binary      numeral system        History     Until the late 1970s  most   minicomputers   did not have a multiply instruction  and so programmers used a  multiply routine  ref   The Evolution of Forth  by Elizabeth D  Rather et  al   http   www forth com resources evolution evolve 2 html   http   www forth com

and accumulates partial results  often written using   loop unwinding       Mainframe computer  s had multiply instructions  but they did the same sorts of shifts and adds as a  multiply routine    Early   microprocessor  s also had no multiply instruction   The   Motorola 6809    introduced circa 1977 78  was one of the earliest microprocessors with a dedicated hardware multiply instruction  It apparently  Citation needed date March 2010   did the same sorts of shifts and adds as a  multiply routine   but implemented in the   microcode   of the MUL instruction   As more   transistor count transistors per chip   became available  Moore s law   it became possible to put enough adders on a single chip to sum all the partial products at once  rather than re use a single adder to handle each partial product one at a time   Because some common   digital signal processing   algorithms spend most of their time multiplying  people who design   digital signal processor  s sacrifice a lot of chip area in order to make the  multiply  as fast as possible a single cycle   multiply accumulate   unit often used up most of the chip area of early DSPs     Multiplication basics   The method taught in school for multiplying decimal numbers  is based on calculating partial products  shifting them to the left and then adding them together  The most difficult part is to obtain the partial products  as that involves multiplying a long number by one digit  from 0 to 9       nowiki     123    x 456               738   this is 123 x 6      615    this is 123 x 5  shifted one position to the left     492     this is 123 x 4  shifted two positions to the left              56088  nowiki   A binary computer does exactly the same  but with binary numbers  In binary encoding each long number is multiplied by one digit  either 0 or 1   and that is much easier than in decimal  as the product by 0 or 1 is just 0 or the same number  Therefore  the multiplication of two binary numbers comes down to calculating partial products  which are 0 or the first number   shifting them left  and then adding them together  a binary addition  of course      nowiki         1011    this is 11 in binary       x 1110    this is 14 in binary                     0000    this is 1011 x 0        1011     this is 1011 x 1  shifted one position to the left       1011      this is 1011 x 1  shifted two positions to the left      1011       this is 1011 x 1  shifted three positions to the left                 10011010    this is 154 in binary   nowiki   This is much simpler than in the decimal system  as there is no table of multiplication to remember  just shifts and adds   This method is mathematically correct  but it has two serious engineering problems  The first is that it involves 32 intermediate additions in a 32 bit computer  or 64 intermediate additions in a 64 bit computer  These additions take a lot of time  The engineering implementation of binary multiplication consists  really  of taking a very simple mathematical process and complicating it a lot  in order to do fewer additions  a modern processor can multiply two 64 bit numbers with 16 additions  rather than 64   and can do several steps in parallel but at a cost of making the process almost unreadable   The second problem is that the basic school method handles the sign with a separate rule     with   yields        with   yields     etc    Modern computers embed the sign of the number in the number itself  usually in the   two s complement   representation  That forces the multiplication process to be adapted to handle two s complement numbers  and that complicates the process a bit more  Similarly  processors that use   one s complement      sign and magnitude      IEEE 754   or other binary representations require specific adjustments to the multiplication process     Engineering approach  an unsigned example   For example  suppose we want to multiply two   signedness unsigned   eight bit integers together    a   7 0  and   b   7 0    We can produce eight partial products by performing eight one bit multiplications  one for each bit in multiplicand   a       nowiki p0 7 0    a 0

nowiki   where  nowiki  8 a 0     nowiki  means repeating a 0   the 0th bit of a  8 times  Verilog notation    To produce our product  we then need to add up all eight of our partial products  as

signedness unsigned   integer  then the partial products would need to have been sign extended up to the width of the product before summing   If   a   had been a signed integer  then partial product   p7   would need to be subtracted from the final sum  rather than added to it   The above array multiplier can be modified to support   two s complement notation   signed numbers by inverting several of the product terms and inserting a one to the left of the first partial product term                                                        1   p0 7   p0 6   p0 5   p0 4   p0 3   p0 2   p0 1   p0 0

There are a lot of simplifications in the bit array above that are not shown and are not obvious   The sequences of one complemented bit followed by noncomplemented bits are implementing a two s complement trick to avoid sign extension   The sequence of p7  noncomplemented bit followed by all complemented bits  is because we re subtracting this term so they were all negated to start out with  and a 1 was added in the least significant position    For both types of sequences  the last bit is flipped and an implicit  1 should be added directly below the MSB   When the  1 from the two s complement negation for p7 in bit position 0  LSB  and all the  1 s in bit columns 7 through 14  where each of the MSBs are located  are added together  they can be simplified to the single 1 that

tree        BST      which may sometimes also be called    ordered    or    sorted    binary tree  is a   Node  computer science  node based     binary tree     data structure   which has the following properties  ref   citation  last1 Gilberg  first1 R   last2 Forouzan  first2 B   title Data Structures  A Pseudocode Approach With C    publisher Brooks Cole  location Pacific Grove  CA  year 2001  isbn 0 534 95216 X  page 339  chapter 8     ref    The left   Tree  data structure  subtrees subtree   of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node s key    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node s key    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees   Generally  the information represented by each node is a    record    rather than a single data element   However  for sequencing purposes  nodes are compared according to their    keys    rather than any part of their associated records   The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related   sorting algorithm  s and   search algorithm  s such as   in order traversal   can be very efficient    Binary search trees are a fundamental   data structure   used to construct more abstract data structures such as   set  computer science  sets      multiset  s  and   associative array  s     Operations   Operations on a binary tree require comparisons between nodes  These comparisons are made with calls to a   comparator  computer science  comparator    which is a   subroutine   that computes the total order  linear order  on any two values  This comparator can be explicitly or implicitly defined  depending on the language in which the BST is implemented      Searching    Searching a binary tree for a specific value can be a   Recursion  computer science  recursive   or   Iteration Computing iterative   process  This explanation covers a recursive method   We begin by examining the   Tree  data structure  root nodes root node    If the tree is null  the value we are searching for does not exist in the tree  Otherwise  if the value equals the root  the search is successful  If the value is less than the root  search the left subtree  Similarly  if it is greater than the root  search the right subtree  This process is repeated until the value is found or the indicated subtree is null  If the searched value is not found before a null subtree is reached  then the item must not be present in the tree   Here is the search algorithm in the   Python  programming language  Python programming language     source lang  python      node  refers to the parent node in this case  def search binary tree node  key        if node is None           return None    key not found      if key   node key

requires   Big O notation O   log   n    time in the average case  but needs   Big O notation O     n    time in the worst case  when the unbalanced tree resembles a   linked list      Binary Tree Types of binary trees degenerate tree      Assuming that BinarySearchTree is a class with a member function  search int   and a pointer to the root node  the algorithm is also easily implemented in terms of an iterative approach  The algorithm enters a loop  and decides whether to branch left or right depending on the value of the node at each parent node     source lang  cpp   bool BinarySearchTree  search int val        Node  next   this  root             while  next    NULL            if  val    next  value                  return true            else if  val   next  value                  next   next  left                 else               next   next  right                                        not found     return false     source      Insertion        This section is linked from   Red black tree       Insertion begins as a search would begin  if the root is not equal to the value  we search the left or right subtrees as before  Eventually  we will reach an external node and add the value as its right or left child  depending on the node s value  In other words  we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if the new value is less than the root  or the right subtree if the new value is greater than or equal to the root   Here s how a typical binary search tree insertion might be performed in   C    programming language  C        source lang  cpp       Inserts the node pointed to by  newNode  into the subtree rooted at  treeNode      void InsertNode Node   treeNode  Node  newNode          if  treeNode    NULL

procedural variant modifies the tree in place  It uses only constant space  but the previous version of the tree is lost  Alternatively  as in the following   Python  programming language  Python   example  we can reconstruct all ancestors of the inserted node  any reference to the original tree root remains valid  making the tree a   persistent data structure      source lang  python    def binary tree insert node  key  value        if node is None           return TreeNode None  key  value  None        if key    node key           return TreeNode node left  key  value  node right       if key   node key           return TreeNode binary tree insert node left  key  value   node key  node value  node right       else           return TreeNode node left  node key  node value  binary tree insert node right  key  value     source   The part that is rebuilt uses   log   n    space in the average case and     n    in the worst case  see   big O notation      In either version  this operation requires time proportional to the height of the tree in the worst case  which is   Big O notation O   log   n    time in the average case over all trees  but     n    time in the worst case   Another way to explain insertion is that in order to insert a new node in the tree  its value is first compared with the value of the root  If its value is less than the root s  it is then compared with the value of the root s left child  If its value is greater  it is compared with the root s right child  This process continues  until the new node is compared with a leaf node  and then it is added as this node s right or left child  depending on its value   There are other ways of inserting nodes into a binary tree  but this is the only way of inserting nodes at the leaves and at the same time preserving the BST structure   Here is an iterative approach to inserting into a binary search tree the in   Java  programming language  Java Programming Language     source lang  java   public

There are three possible cases to consider       Deleting a leaf  node with no children      Deleting a leaf is easy  as we can simply remove it from the tree       Deleting a node with one child     Remove the node and replace it with its child       Deleting a node with two children     Call the node to be deleted   N     Do not delete   N     Instead  choose either its in order successor node or its in order predecessor node    R     Replace the value of   N   with the value of   R    then delete   R     As with all binary trees  a node s in order successor is the left most child of its right subtree  and a node s in order predecessor is the right most child of its left subtree  In either case  this node will have zero or one children  Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above    Image binary search tree delete svg frame center Deleting a node with two children from a binary search tree   The triangles represent subtrees of arbitrary size  each with its leftmost and rightmost child nodes at the bottom two vertices     Consistently using the in order successor or the in order predecessor for every instance of the two child case can lead to an   Balanced tree unbalanced   tree  so good implementations add inconsistency to this selection   Running Time Analysis  Although this operation does not always traverse the tree down to a leaf  this is always a possibility  thus in the worst case it requires time proportional to the height of the tree  It does not require more even when the node has two children  since it still follows a single path and does not visit any node twice   Here is the code in Python    source lang  python   def findMin self               Finds the smallest element that is a child of  self              current node   self

than  self              successor   self right child findMin               self key   successor key               if  successor  has a child  replace it with that               at this point  it can only have a  right child                if it has no children   right child  will be  None              successor replace node in parent successor right child          elif self left child or self right child      if the node has only one child             if self left child                  self replace node in parent self left child              else                  self replace node in parent self right child          else    this node has no children             self replace node in parent None     source      Traversal      main Tree traversal   Once the binary search tree has been created  its elements can be retrieved   in order traversal in order   by   recursion recursively   traversing the left subtree of the root node  accessing the node itself  then recursively traversing the right subtree of the node  continuing this pattern with each node in the tree as it s recursively accessed  As with all binary trees  one may conduct a   pre order traversal   or a   post order traversal    but neither are likely to be useful for binary search trees   The code for in order traversal in Python is given below  It will call    callback    for every node in the tree    source lang  python   def traverse binary tree node  callback       if node is None          return     traverse binary tree node leftChild  callback      callback node value      traverse binary tree node rightChild  callback    source   Traversal requires   Big O notation Related asymptotic notations     n      time  since it must visit every node  This algorithm is also O   n     so it is   asymptotically optimal        Sort    A binary search tree can be used to implement a simple but efficient   sorting algorithm    Similar to   heapsort    we insert all the values we wish to sort into a new ordered data structure mdash in this case a binary search tree mdash and then traverse it in order  building our result    source lang  python   def build binary tree values       tree   None     for v in values          tree   binary tree insert tree  v      return tree  def get inorder traversal root               Returns a list containing all the values in the tree  starting at  root       Traverses the tree in order leftChild  root  rightChild               result          traverse binary tree root  lambda element  result append element       return result   source   The worst case time of  code build binary tree  code  is  math O n 2   math  mdash if you feed it a sorted list of values  it chains them into a   linked list   with no left subtrees  For example   code traverse binary tree  1  2  3  4  5    code  yields the tree  code  1  2  3  4  5       code     There are several schemes for overcoming this flaw with simple binary trees  the most common is the   self balancing binary search tree    If this same procedure is done using such a tree  the overall worst case time is   Big O notation O     n  log   n     which is   asymptotically optimal   for a   comparison sort    In practice  the poor   CPU cache cache   performance and added overhead in time and space for a tree based sort  particularly for node   dynamic memory allocation allocation    make it inferior to other asymptotically optimal sorts such as    heapsort   for static list sorting  On the other hand  it is one of the most efficient methods of   incremental sorting    adding items to a list over time while keeping the list sorted at all times     Types   There are many types of binary search trees    AVL tree  s and   red black tree  s are both forms of   self balancing binary search tree  s  A   splay tree   is a binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements nearer to the root  In a   treap     tree   heap  data structure  heap      each node also holds a priority and the parent node has higher priority than its children   Two other titles describing binary search trees are that of a    complete    and    degenerate    tree   A complete tree is a tree with n levels  where for each level d    n   1  the number of existing nodes at level d is equal to 2 sup d  sup   This means all possible nodes exist at these levels  An additional requirement for a complete binary tree is that for the n sup th  sup  level  while every node does not have to exist  the nodes that do exist must fill from left to right   A degenerate tree is a tree where for each parent node  there is only one associated child node  What this means is that in a performance measurement  the tree will essentially behave like a linked list data structure      Performance comparisons    D  A  Heger  2004  ref    Citation   title A Disquisition on The Performance Behavior of Binary Search Tree Data Structures   first1 Dominique A    last1

performance comparison of binary search trees    Treap   was found to have the best average performance  while   red black tree   was found to have the smallest amount of performance fluctuations      Optimal binary search trees    If we don t plan on modifying a search tree  and we know exactly how often each item will be accessed  we can construct an    optimal binary search tree     which is a search tree where the average cost of looking up an item  the   expected search cost    is minimized   Even if we only have estimates of the search costs  such a system can considerably speed up lookups on average  For example  if you have a BST of English words used in a   spell checker    you might balance the tree based on word frequency in   text corpus text corpora    placing words like  the  near the root and words like  agerasia  near the leaves  Such a tree might be compared with   Huffman tree  s  which similarly seek to place frequently used items near the root in order to produce a dense information encoding  however  Huffman trees only store data elements in leaves and these elements need not be ordered   If we do not know the sequence in which the elements in the tree will be accessed in advance  we can use   splay tree  s which are asymptotically as good as any static search tree we can construct for any particular sequence of lookup operations      Alphabetic trees    are Huffman trees with the additional constraint on order  or  equivalently  search trees with the modification that all elements are stored in the leaves  Faster algorithms exist

However  in certain binary trees these nodes   can   be deleted  including   binary search tree binary search trees         Iteration     Often  one wishes to visit each of the nodes in a tree and examine the value there  a process called   iteration   or   enumeration    There are several common orders in which the nodes can be visited  and each has useful properties that are exploited in algorithms based on binary trees     Pre Order       Root first  children after   Post Order      Children first  root after   In Order        Left child  root  right child        Pre order  in order  and post order traversal        Main Tree traversal    Pre order  in order  and post order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root  If the root node is visited before its subtrees  this is pre order  if after  post order  if between  in order  In order traversal is useful in   binary search tree  s  where this traversal visits the nodes in increasing order        Depth first order      In depth first order  we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root that we can  but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited  Unlike a depth first search on graphs  there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited  because a tree cannot contain cycles  Pre order is a special case of this  See   depth first search   for more information        Breadth first order      Contrasting with depth first order is breadth first order  which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited  See   breadth first search   for more information  Also called a   level order traversal       Type theory    In   type theory    a binary tree with nodes of type A is defined   inductive datatype inductively   as   T   sub   A    sub        1     A    times     times        Definition in graph theory    For each binary tree data structure  there is equivalent rooted   binary tree  graph theory  binary tree   in graph theory     graph theory Graph theorists   use the following definition  A binary tree is a   connected graph connected     acyclic graph   such that the   degree  graph theory  degree   of each   vertex  graph theory  vertex   is no more than three  It can be shown that in any binary tree of two or more nodes  there are exactly two more nodes of degree one than there are of degree three  but there can be any number of nodes of degree two  A    rooted binary tree    is such a graph that has one of its vertices of degree no more than two singled out as the root   With the root thus chosen  each vertex will have a uniquely defined parent  and up to two children  however  so far there is insufficient information to distinguish a left or right child  If we drop the connectedness requirement  allowing multiple   connected component  graph theory  connected components   in the graph  we call such a structure a forest   Another way of defining binary trees is a recursive definition on directed graphs  A binary tree is either    A single vertex    A graph formed by taking two binary trees  adding a vertex  and adding an edge directed from the new vertex to the root of each binary tree  This also does not establish the order of children  but does fix a specific root node     Combinatorics    In combinatorics one considers the problem of counting the number of binary trees of a given size   Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes  this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor   and trees are distinguished only by their structure  however the left and right child of any node are distinguished  if they are different trees  then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one   The size of the tree is taken to be the number   n   of internal nodes  those with two children   the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are   nowrap   n     1   of them  The number of such binary trees of size   n   is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of   nowrap   n     1   symbols  representing leaves  separated by   n   binary operators  representing internal nodes   so as to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator  For instance for   nowrap   n         3   one has to parenthesize a string like   nowrap   math X X X X  math     which is possible in five ways     math   X X  X  X  qquad  X  X X   X  qquad  X X   X X   qquad X   X X  X   qquad X  X  X X     math  The correspondence to binary trees should be obvious  and the addition of redundant parentheses  around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression  is disallowed  or at least not counted as producing a new possibility    There is a unique binary tree of size 0  consisting of a single leaf   and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children  if these have sizes   i   and   j   respectively  the full tree has size   nowrap   i       j     1    Therefore the number  math C n  math  of binary trees of size   n   has the following recursive description  math C 0 1  math   and  math  textstyle C n  sum  i 0   n 1 C iC  n 1 i   math  for any positive integer   n    It follows that  math C n  math  is the   Catalan number   of index   n     The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2  n   in the   Dyck language    which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced  The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description  each Dyck word of length 2  n   is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial     and its matching     together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis  whose lengths 2  i   and 2  j   satisfy   nowrap   i       j     1         n       this number is therefore also the Catalan number  math C n  math   So there are also five Dyck words of length 10     math         qquad         qquad         qquad         qquad         math   These Dyck words do not correspond in an obvious way to binary trees  A bijective correspondence can nevertheless be defined as follows  enclose the Dyck word in a extra pair of parentheses  so that the result can be interpreted as a   Lisp   list expression  with the empty list    as only occurring atom   then the   Lisp  programming language  S expressions represent lists dotted pair   expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression  with NIL as symbol and     as operator  describing the corresponding binary tree  which is in fact the internal representation of the proper list    The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a   free magma   on a singleton set      Methods for storing binary trees        This section is linked from   Ahnentafel       Binary trees can be constructed from   programming language   primitives in several ways       Nodes and references      In a language with   record  computer science  records   and   reference  computer science  reference  s  binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child  Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent  If a node has fewer than two children  some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value  or to a special   sentinel node     In languages with   tagged union  s such as   ML  programming language  ML    a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes  one of which is a 3 tuple of data  left child  and right child  and the other of which is a  leaf  node  which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers       Ahnentafel list      Binary trees can also be stored as an   implicit data structure   in   array data structure array  s  and if the tree is a complete binary tree  this method wastes no space  In this compact arrangement  if a node has an index   i    its

stored in an array    center   A binary tree can also be represented in the form of array as well as adjacency linked list  In the case of array  each node root left right  is simply placed in the index and there is no connection mentioned about the relationship between parents and children  However  in linked list representation we can find the relationship between parent and children  In array representation the nodes are accessed by calculating the index  This method is used in languages like FORTRAN which doesn t have dynamic memory allocation  We can t insert a new node into array implemented binary tree with ease  but this is easily done when using a binary tree implemented as linked list      Encodings        Succinct encodings     A   succinct data structure   is one which

allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they re still in their succinct form       Encoding general trees as binary trees     There is a one to one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees  which in particular is used by   Lisp  programming language  Lisp   to represent general ordered trees as binary trees  To convert a general ordered tree to binary tree  we only need to represent the general tree in left child sibling way  The result of this representation will be automatically binary tree  if viewed from a different perspective  Each node   N   in the ordered tree corresponds to a node   N     in the binary tree  the   left   child of   N     is the node corresponding to the first child of   N    and the   right   child of   N     is the node corresponding to   N    s next sibling     that is  the next node in order among the children of the parent of   N    This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a   left child right sibling binary tree    LCRS tree   or a   doubly chained tree    or a   Filial Heir chain     One way of thinking about this is that each node s children are in a   linked list    chained together with their   right   fields  and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list  through its   left   field   For example  in the tree on the left  A has the 6 children  B C D E F G    It can be converted into the binary tree on the right    center    Image N ary to binary svg 400x240px An example of converting an n ary

 next sibling     The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as       N O  I J  C D   P   Q   F  M    which would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right  without any letters on those nodes that have a left child     See also       2 3 tree       2 3 4 tree       AA tree       B tree       Binary space partitioning       Elastic binary tree       Kraft s inequality

3840|Binaural fusion|  Orphan date October 2006       Binaural fusion    is a   cognitive   process that involves the  fusion  or integration of different auditory information presented binaurally  or to each   ear    In humans  this process is essential in understanding speech as one ear may pick up more information about the speech stimuli than the other  Each ear sends the signal it receives up the  central auditory nervous system  or CANS where it is fused as one complete  auditory picture  at the level of the brainstem   This process is also used by both humans and animals to determine the direction from which   sound  s are heard  wherein the brain compares information from each ear and then translates the differences into a unified perception of the point in space from which a sound originates  The spatial cues include differences in the   arrival time   and the intensity  or force  of sound waves reaching the ears from a specific point in space  These cues are processed in parallel as a series of distinct steps  eventually converging as the perception of a single sound  The difference in arrival time of sounds between the ears is used to determine the direction of a sound source in the horizontal plane    The auditory system derives the   pitch  music  pitch   of complex tones from the tone s   harmonic  s  The processing of pitch in the   auditory cortex    via binaural fusion  enables locations to be determined     Binaural fusion in  C APD testing   Many tests have been created to try and diagnose  C APD   central  auditory processing disorder  by assessing the CANS  binaural fusion ability  These tests have been shown to be moderately sensitive for diagnosing brainstem lesions     See also       Holonomic brain theory      External links      http   www pnas org cgi content full 95 11 6465 ck nck PNAS org     How do owls localize interaurally phase ambiguous signals   Kourosh Saberi  Haleh Farahbod  Masakazu Konishi    California Institute of Technology        Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences       May 26  1998     Category Cognition      neuroscience stub

3851|Binomial heap|In   computer science    a    binomial heap    is a   Heap  data structure  heap   similar to a   binary heap   but also supports quickly merging two heaps  This is achieved by using a special tree structure  It is important as an implementation of the    mergeable heap      abstract data type    also called meldable heap   which is a   priority queue   supporting merge operation     Binomial tree   A binomial heap is implemented as a collection of binomial   tree data structure tree  s  compare with a   binary heap    which has a shape of a single   binary tree     A    binomial tree    is defined recursively     A binomial tree of order 0 is a single node   A binomial tree of order   k   has a root node whose children are roots of binomial trees of orders   k   1    k   2       2  1  0  in this order      Image Binomial Trees svg center thumb 500px Binomial trees of order 0 to 3  Each tree has a root node with subtrees of all lower ordered binomial trees  which have been highlighted  For example  the order 3 binomial tree is connected to an order 2  1  and 0  highlighted as blue  green and red respectively  binomial tree     A binomial tree of order   k   has 2 sup k  sup  nodes  height   k     Because of its unique structure  a binomial tree of order   k   can be constructed from two trees of order   k   1 trivially by attaching one of them as the leftmost child of the other one  This feature is central to the   merge   operation of a binomial heap  which is its major advantage over other conventional heaps   The name comes from the shape  a binomial tree of order  math n  math  has  math  tbinom n d  math  nodes at depth  math d  math    See   Binomial coefficient        Structure of a binomial heap   A binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees that satisfy the   binomial heap properties       Each binomial tree in a heap obeys the     minimum heap property      the key of a node is greater than or equal to the key of its parent     There can only be either   one   or   zero   binomial trees for each order  including zero order   The first property ensures that the root of each binomial tree contains the smallest key in the tree  which applies to the entire heap   The second property implies that a binomial heap with   n   nodes consists of at most   Binary logarithm log     n     1 binomial trees  In fact  the number and orders of these trees are uniquely determined by the number of nodes   n    each binomial tree corresponds to one digit in the   binary numeral system binary   representation of number   n    For example number 13 is 1101 in binary   math 2 3   2 2   2 0  math   and thus a binomial heap with 13 nodes will consist of three binomial trees of orders 3  2  and 0  see figure below     center   Image Binomial heap 13 svg 325px Example of a binomial heap   br   Example of a binomial heap containing 13 nodes with distinct keys  br  The heap consists of three binomial trees with orders 0  2  and 3     center     Implementation    Because no operation requires random access to the root nodes of the binomial trees  the roots of the binomial trees can be stored in a   linked list    ordered by increasing order of the tree      Merge    As mentioned above  the simplest and most important operation is the merging of two binomial trees of the same order within two binomial heaps  Due to the structure of binomial trees  they can be merged trivially  As their root node is the smallest element within the tree  by comparing the two keys  the smaller of them is the minimum key  and becomes the new root node  Then the other tree become a subtree of the combined tree  This operation is basic to the complete merging of two binomial heaps       function    mergeTree p  q          if    p root    q root             return    p addSubTree q          else                return    q addSubTree p     Image Binomial heap merge1 svg left thumb 200px To merge two binomial trees of the same order  first compare the root key  Since 7 3  the black tree on the left with root node 7  is attached to the grey tree on the right with root node 3  as a subtree  The result is a tree of order 3     The operation of    merging    two heaps is perhaps the most interesting and can be used as a subroutine in most other operations  The lists of roots of both heaps are traversed simultaneously  similarly as in the   merge algorithm     If only one of the heaps contains a tree of order   j    this tree is moved to the merged heap  If both heaps contain a tree of order   j    the two trees are merged to one tree of order   j   1 so that the minimum heap property is satisfied  Note that it may later be necessary to merge this tree with some other tree of order   j   1 present in one of the heaps  In the course of the algorithm  we need to examine at most three trees of any order  two from the two heaps we merge and one composed of two smaller trees    Because each binomial tree in a binomial heap corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of its size  there is an analogy between the merging of two heaps and the binary addition of the   sizes   of the two heaps  from right to left  Whenever a carry occurs during addition  this corresponds to a merging of two binomial trees during the merge   Each tree has order at most log   n   and therefore the running time is   O   log   n          function    merge p  q          while       not     p end      and    q end       tree   mergeTree p currentTree    q currentTree         if       not    heap currentTree   empty         tree   mergeTree tree  heap currentTree          heap addTree tree       else          heap addTree tree    heap next   p next   q next      Image Binomial heap merge2 svg right thumb 300px This shows the merger of two binomial heaps  This is accomplished by merging two binomial trees of the same order one by one  If the resulting merged tree has the same order as one binomial tree in one of the two heaps  then those two are merged again        Insert       Inserting    a new element to a heap can be done by simply creating a new heap containing only this element and then merging it with the original heap  Due to the merge  insert takes O log   n    time however it has an   amortized   time of O 1   i e  constant       Find minimum    To find the    minimum    element of the heap  find the minimum among the roots of the binomial trees  This can again be done easily in   O   log   n    time  as there are just   O   log   n    trees and hence roots to examine   By using a pointer to the binomial tree that contains the minimum element  the time for this operation can be reduced to   O   1   The pointer must be updated when performing any operation other than Find minimum  This can be done in   O   log   n    without raising the running time of any operation      Delete minimum    To    delete the minimum element    from the heap  first find this element  remove it from its binomial tree  and obtain a list of its subtrees  Then transform this list of subtrees into a separate binomial heap by reordering them from smallest to largest order  Then merge this heap with the original heap  Since each tree has at most log   n   children  creating this new heap is   O   log   n     Merging heaps is   O   log   n     so the entire delete minimum operation is   O   log   n          function    deleteMin heap       min   heap trees   first           for each    current    in    heap trees               if    current root   min    then    min   current         for each    tree    in    min subTrees            tmp addTree tree       heap removeTree min       merge heap  tmp      Decrease key    After    decreasing    the key of an element  it may become smaller than the key of its parent  violating the minimum heap property  If this is the case  exchange the element with its parent  and possibly also with its grandparent  and so on  until the minimum heap property is no longer violated  Each binomial tree has height at most log   n    so this takes   O   log   n    time      Delete    To    delete    an element from the heap  decrease its key to negative infinity  that is  some value lower than any element in the heap  and then delete the minimum in the heap     Performance   All of the following operations work in   Big O notation O   log   n    time on a binomial heap with   n   elements     Insert a new element to the heap   Find the element with minimum key   Delete the element with minimum key from the heap   Decrease key of a given element   Delete given element from the heap   Merge two given heaps to one heap  Finding the element with minimum key can also be done in   O   1  by using an additional pointer to the minimum    Applications

Framework program and was initiated on December 1  2004  The main objective of the Network is to demonstrate how the use of modern   simulation   techniques through a deeper and more qualitative description of   the underlying biological  pathological and pharmacological processes can lead to a more rational drug development process and an improved treatment of diseases such as cancer diabetes and depression  At the same time  the biosimulation offers the possibility of reduction in the use of animal experiments      class  wikitable       Host Organization  Technical University of

and the regulatory agencies in Denmark  Sweden  Spain and the Netherlands  BioSim commands a broad range of expertises including genetics  biochemistry  cell biology  physiology  pharmacology on the biological side as well as pharmacokinetics  bioinformatics  complex systems theory  and software development on the technical side  Several of the leading groups have worked in the areas of  biosimulation  and  computational systems biology  for more than 30 years  and the Network also includes hospital departments that perform experimental treatment of patients with cancer and Parkinson s disease     The BioSim Network aims at demonstrating how the use of advanced mathematical modelling and computer simulation can contribute to the development of effective and personalized treatments of different chronic progressive disorders and how the same approach can lead to a reduction of the costs and lead times associated with the development of new medicines  This may gradually allow us to reduce the need for animal experiments      1  Diabetes    Efforts in this area concentrate on the role of mutations that effect the ion channels of the insulin producing beta cells  on the genetic basis for the development of neonatal diabetes  on the study of human  as opposed to mice  pancreatic cells  on the mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance  and on the possible role of prenatal nutrition for the development of type 2 diabetes  Models are also developed to analyse the balance between fat and glucose metabolism and to describe the rate of absorption of different insulin variants       2  Cancer    In this area the Network uses detailed computer models of the cell cycle and of its coupling to the 24 h day and night rhythm to improve the treatment of patients with cancer  The use of chronotherapy implies that the administration of anti cancer drugs is adjusted in accordance with the circadian rhythm of the individual patient  For certain forms of cancer this has been found to increase the efficiency of the drug by a factor of 5  Efforts are also devoted to the development of new anti cancer drugs       3  Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases    The activities in this area focus on the development of 3D heart models that can be used to test how a new drug affects the regularity of the heart rhythm  Work is also performed to develop detailed models of the mechanisms by which the individual nephron of the kidney regulates the incoming blood flow and how neighboring nephrons interact       4  Mental disorders and neuronal systems    Work in this area includes application of mathematical models to develop less invasive and demand controlled electrical stimulation techniques for the treatment of Parkinson s disease  Modelling studies are also performed to examine the effect of sleep deprivation in the treatment of depression  and bioinformatic approaches are applied to try to identify different forms of depression on the basis of the information available from blood samples       5  Methodological issues    This area encompasses description of complex networks of oscillating biological units  studies of the mechanisms of temperature stabilization in biological feedback regulations  application of new methods of data analysis  and development of modeling software and biomedical search machines  The area also includes application of new experimental techniques such as interference microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study cellular processes       6  Regulatory issues and dialogue with the public    Testing in animal and human subjects is a necessary part of the development of new drugs  Such experiments clearly raises a number of complicated ethical issues that the use of simulation models may reduce  This requires that the regulatory authorities can evaluate computer models and accept them as part of the required documentation  At the same time it is important that the public receives information both about the potential of biosimulation and about the enormous challenges the field has to overcome to realize this potential    During the last 5 years the BioSim Network has published 9 books and of the order of 800 scientific publications  The Network has organized or co organized close to 30 conferences and workshops  edited 4 special issues of international journals  and trained about 130 PhD students  New National Centres in Systems Biology have been established in relation to the BioSim partners in Manchester  Warwick  and Edinburgh      Conclusion    The BioSim Network has now reached the end of its 4th year  and the issue of sustainability  i e  the possibility of continuing our activities  naturally comes to the forefront  All BioSim partners have expressed a clear and unconditional wish to continue the collaboration  Together with representatives from other networks of excellence in the Health area BioSim has participated in a meeting on  The Sustainability of Networks  with representatives from   European Union the EU   Research Directorate in Brussels  It appears that many national representatives have provided feedback to the Research Directorate that focuses on the administrative difficulties of running such a large research collaboration  On the other hand  the broad range of different specialities required to establish the new field of systems biology and demonstrate its results must involve contributions from many different partners   During a workshop in Malm  and Governing Board and Steering Group meetings in Oxford and The Hague  our discussions have focused primarily on projects offered by the Innovative Medicines Initiative  IMI   We have  unfortunately concluded  however  that this initiative does not allow for such broad and generic research in the development of predictive and mechanism based models and  in particular  it does not include research projects that would allow a major part of BioSim to continue the already established collaboration      External links and References       The BioSim website  http   biosim network eu     1  Frederick Marcus  Bioinformatics and

3881|Biochip|  Context date October 2009      Image Biochip jpg thumb Hundreds of gel drops are visible on the biochip   The development of    biochips    is a major thrust of the rapidly growing   biotechnology   industry  which encompasses a very diverse range of research efforts including   genomics      proteomics    and   pharmaceuticals    among other activities  Advances in these areas are giving scientists new methods for unravelling the complex biochemical processes occurring inside cells  with the larger goal of understanding and treating human diseases  At the same time  the   semiconductor industry   has been steadily perfecting the science of micro miniaturization  The merging of these two fields in recent years has enabled biotechnologists to begin packing their traditionally bulky sensing tools into smaller and smaller spaces  onto so called biochips  These chips are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions  Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes  from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents     History   The development of biochips has a long history  starting with early work on the underlying   sensor   technology  One of the first portable  chemistry based sensors was the   glass electrode glass pH electrode    invented in 1922 by Hughes  Hughes  1922   Measurement of   pH   was accomplished by detecting the potential difference developed across a thin glass membrane selective to the permeation of hydrogen ions  this selectivity was achieved by exchanges between H sup    sup  and SiO sites in the glass  The basic concept of using exchange sites to create permselective membranes was used to develop other   Ion selective electrode ion sensors   in subsequent years  For example  a K sup    sup  sensor was produced by incorporating   valinomycin   into a thin membrane  Schultz  1996   Over thirty years elapsed before the first true   biosensor      i e    a sensor utilizing biological molecules  emerged  In 1956  Leland Clark published a paper on an   Clark electrode oxygen sensing electrode    Clark  1956 41   This device became the basis for a   glucose   sensor developed in 1962 by Clark and colleague Lyons which utilized   glucose oxidase   molecules embedded in a   dialysis   membrane  Clark  1962   The   enzyme   functioned in the presence of glucose to decrease the amount of oxygen available to the oxygen electrode  thereby relating oxygen levels to glucose concentration  This and similar biosensors became known as enzyme electrodes  and are still in use today   In 1953    Watson and Crick   announced their discovery of the now familiar   double helix   structure of   DNA   molecules and set the stage for   genetics   research that continues to the present day  Nelson  2000   The development of   sequencing   techniques in 1977 by   Walter Gilbert Gilbert    Maxam  1977  and   Frederick Sanger Sanger    Sanger  1977   working separately  enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for   protein biosynthesis protein synthesis    This research showed how   hybridisation  molecular biology  hybridization   of complementary single   oligonucleotide   strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing  Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA based biosensors  First  in 1983   Kary Mullis   invented the   polymerase chain reaction    PCR  technique  Nelson  2000   a method for amplifying DNA concentrations  This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples  Second  in 1986 Hood and co workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with   fluorescent tag  s instead of radiolabels  Smith  1986   thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically   The rapid technological advances of the   biochemistry   and   semiconductor   fields in the 1980s led to the large scale development of biochips in the 1990s  At this time  it became clear that biochips were largely a  platform  technology which consisted of several separate  yet integrated components  Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform  The actual sensing component  or  chip   is just one piece of a complete analysis system    Transducer Transduction   must be done to translate the actual sensing event  DNA binding    redox oxidation reduction      etc     into a format understandable by a computer    voltage    light intensity  mass    etc      which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final    human readable   output  The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip  mdash  from sensing chemistry  to   microarray  ing  to signal processing  mdash  require a true multidisciplinary approach  making the barrier to entry steep  One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by   Affymetrix    Their  GeneChip  products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects  or single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs   in genes such as   p53    a tumor suppressor  and   BRCA1   and   BRCA2    related to breast cancer   Cheng  2001   The chips are produced using   microlithography   techniques traditionally used to fabricate   integrated circuits    see below      image Biochip platform jpg frame thumb right 300 px Figure 1  Biochips are a platform that require  in addition to microarray technology  transduction and signal processing technologies to output the results of sensing experiments     Today  a large variety of biochip technologies are either in development or being commercialized  Numerous advancements continue to be made in sensing research that enable new platforms to be developed for new applications  Cancer diagnosis through DNA typing is just one market opportunity  A variety of industries currently desire the ability to simultaneously screen for a wide range of chemical and biological agents  with purposes ranging from testing public water systems for disease agents to screening airline cargo for explosives  Pharmaceutical companies wish to combinatorially screen drug candidates against target enzymes  To achieve these ends    DNA      RNA      proteins    and even living cells are being employed as sensing mediators on biochips  Potera  2008   Numerous transduction methods can be employed including   surface plasmon resonance      fluorescence    and   chemiluminescence    The particular sensing and transduction techniques chosen depend on factors such as price  sensitivity  and reusability     Microarray fabrication   The microarray  mdash  the dense  two dimensional grid of biosensors  mdash  is the critical component of a biochip platform  Typically  the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate  which may either be passive    e g    silicon or glass  or active  the latter consisting of integrated electronics or   microtechnology micromechanical   devices that perform or assist signal transduction    Surface chemistry   is used to   covalent bond covalently bind   the sensor molecules to the substrate medium  The fabrication of microarrays is non trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms  The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position  typically on a   Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian   grid  on the substrate  Various means exist to achieve the placement  but typically robotic micro pipetting  Schena  1995  or micro printing  MacBeath  1999  systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface  Because each sensor is unique  only a few spots can be placed at a time  The low throughput nature of this process results in high manufacturing costs   Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process  later used by   Affymetrix    in which a series of microlithography steps is used to   Combinatorial chemistry combinatorially synthesize   hundreds of thousands of unique  single stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one   nucleotide   at a time  Fodor  1991  Pease  1994   One lithography step is needed per base type  thus  a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level  Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously  it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands  15 ndash 25 nucleotides   Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done  Furthermore  light directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules   As noted above  most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors  This approach is used chiefly to map or  encode  the coordinate of each sensor to its function  Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique    e g    fluorescence   thus making coordinates their only identifying feature  These arrays must be made using a serial process    i e    requiring multiple  sequential steps  to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position    Random  fabrication  in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip  is an alternative to the serial method  The tedious and expensive positioning process is not required  enabling the use of parallelized self assembly techniques  In this approach  large batches of identical sensors can be produced  sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array  A non coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor  As the figure shows  such a design was first demonstrated  and later commercialized by Illumina  using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched   fiber optic   cable  Steemers  2000  Michael  1998  Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature  However  this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated     Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies     Microarray  s are not limited to   DNA   analysis    protein microarray  s    antibody microarray      chemical compound microarray   can also be produced using biochips    http   www randox com Randox  Laboratories Ltd  launched Evidence  the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003   In protein Biochip Array Technology  the biochip replaces the   ELISA   plate or   cuvette   as the reaction platform   The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample  producing a   patient   profile   The patient profile can be used in disease screening    medical diagnosis diagnosis    monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment   Performing multiple analyses simultaneously  described as multiplexing  allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required   Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology  using sandwich  competitive and antibody capture   immunoassay  s   The difference from conventional immunoassays is that the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution   In sandwich assays an enzyme labelled antibody is used  in competitive assays an enzyme labelled antigen is used   On antibody antigen binding a   chemiluminescence   reaction produces light   Detection is by a   charge coupled device    CCD  camera   The CCD camera is a sensitive and high resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light   The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes   Details about other array technologies can be found in the following page    Antibody microarray      See also       DNA microarray       Protein array       Chemical compound microarray

3890|Biogeochemistry|   Biogeochemistry    is the scientific discipline that involves the study of the   chemistry chemical      physics physical      geology geological    and   biology biological   processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment  including the   biosphere    the   hydrosphere    the   pedosphere    the   Earth s atmosphere atmosphere    and the

Biotechnology Information NCBI   website   Assembly of the   human genome   is one of the greatest achievements of bioinformatics        Bioinformatics    is the application of   statistics   and   computer science   to the field of   molecular biology     The term   bioinformatics   was coined by   Paulien Hogeweg   and Ben Hesper in 1978 for the study of informatic processes in biotic systems ref Hogeweg  P   1978   Simulating the growth of cellular forms  Simulation 31  90 96  Hogeweg  P  and  Hesper  B   1978  Interactive instruction on population interactions  Comput Biol Med 8 319 27   ref   Its primary use since at least the late 1980s has been in genomics and genetics  particularly in those areas of genomics involving large scale   DNA sequencing     Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases  algorithms  computational and statistical techniques and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data   Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology  It is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes   Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing   DNA   and protein sequences  aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them and creating and viewing 3 D models of protein structures   The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes  What sets it apart from other approaches  however  is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques  e g     pattern recognition      data mining      machine learning   algorithms  and   Biological Data Visualization visualization    to achieve this goal  Major research efforts in the field include   sequence alignment      gene finding      genome assembly      drug design      drug discovery      protein structural alignment protein structure alignment      protein structure prediction    prediction of   gene expression   and   protein protein interactions      genome wide association studies   and the modeling of   evolution       Introduction   Bioinformatics was applied in the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information at the beginning of the  genomic revolution   such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences  Development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access existing data as well as submit new or revised data   In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states  the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities  Therefore  the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data  including nucleotide and amino acid sequences  protein domains  and protein structures  The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology  Important sub disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include    the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access to  and use and management of  various types of information    the development of new algorithms  mathematical formulas  and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets  such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence  predict protein structure and or function  and cluster protein

became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually  Today    computer program  s such as   BLAST   are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms  containing over 190 billion

thousands of small DNA fragments  ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long  depending on the sequencing technology   The ends of these fragments overlap and  when aligned properly by a genome assembly program  can be used to reconstruct the complete genome  Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly  but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes  For a genome as large as the   human genome    it may take many days of CPU time on large memory  multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments  and the resulting assembly will usually contain numerous gaps that have to be filled in later  Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today  and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research   Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation  which involves computational   gene finding   to search for protein coding genes  RNA genes  and other functional sequences within a genome  Not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes  Within the genome of higher organisms  large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose  This so called   junk DNA   may  however  contain unrecognized functional elements  Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and   proteome   projects  mdash  for example  in the use of DNA sequences for protein identification     see also sequence analysis sequence profiling tool sequence motif       Genome annotation      main Gene finding    In the context of   genomics         Genome project Genome annotation annotation      is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence  The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by Dr  Owen White  who was part of the team at   The Institute for Genomic Research   that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free living organism to be decoded  the bacterium     Haemophilus influenzae      Dr  White built a software system to find the genes  places in the DNA sequence that encode a protein   the transfer RNA  and other features  and to make initial assignments of function to those genes  Most current genome annotation systems work similarly  but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA are constantly changing and improving      Computational evolutionary biology      Evolutionary biology   is the study of the origin and descent of   species    as well as their change over time    Informatics  academic field  Informatics   has assisted evolutionary biologists in several key ways  it has enabled researchers to    trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their   DNA    rather than through   physical taxonomy   or physiological observations alone    more recently  compare entire   genomes    which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events  such as   gene duplication      horizontal gene transfer    and the prediction of factors important in bacterial   speciation      build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time   track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex   Evolutionary tree tree of life     The area of research within   computer science   that uses   genetic algorithm  s is sometimes confused with   computational evolutionary biology    but the two areas are not necessarily related      Analysis of gene expression    The   gene expression expression   of many genes can be determined by measuring   Messenger RNA mRNA   levels with multiple techniques including   DNA microarray microarrays      expressed sequence tag expressed cDNA sequence tag    EST  sequencing    serial analysis of gene expression    SAGE  tag sequencing    massively parallel signature sequencing    MPSS   or various applications of multiplexed in situ hybridization  All of these techniques are extremely noise prone and or subject to bias in the biological measurement  and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate   signal  information theory  signal   from   noise   in high throughput gene expression studies  Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder  one might compare microarray data from cancerous   epithelial   cells to data from non cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up regulated and down regulated in a particular population of cancer cells      Analysis of regulation    Regulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an extracellular signal such as a   hormone   and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more   protein  s  Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process  For example    promoter analysis   involves the identification and study of   sequence motif  s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene  These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA  Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation  one might compare   microarray   data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state  In a single cell organism  one might compare stages of the   cell cycle    along with various stress conditions  heat shock  starvation  etc    One can then apply   cluster analysis clustering algorithms   to that expression data to determine which genes are co expressed  For example  the upstream regions  promoters  of co expressed genes can be searched for over represented   regulatory elements        Analysis of protein expression      Protein microarray  s and high throughput  HT    mass spectrometry    MS  can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample  Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data  the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA  the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases  and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple  but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected      Analysis of mutations in cancer    In cancer  the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways  Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown   point mutation  s in a variety of   gene  s in   cancer    Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced  and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of   human genome   sequences and   germline   polymorphisms  New physical detection technologies are employed  such as   oligonucleotide   microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses  called   comparative genomic hybridization     and   single nucleotide polymorphism   arrays to detect known   point mutations    These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome  and when used in high throughput to measure thousands of samples  generate   terabyte  s of data per experiment  Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians  The data is often found to contain considerable variability  or   noise    and thus   Hidden Markov model   and   change point analysis   methods are being developed to infer real   copy number variation copy number   changes   Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of   lesion  s found to be recurrent among many tumors      this is specific enough  compared to general knowledge in previous paragraph  that it would be nice to have a source or example           Comparative genomics      main Comparative genomics    The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between   genes      orthology   analysis  or other genomic features in different organisms  It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes  A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution  At the lowest level  point mutations affect individual nucleotides  At a higher level  large chromosomal segments undergo duplication  lateral transfer  inversion  transposition  deletion and insertion  Ultimately  whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization  polyploidization and   endosymbiosis    often leading to rapid speciation  The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms  who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic  statistical and mathematical techniques  ranging from exact    heuristics    fixed parameter and   approximation algorithms   for problems based on parsimony models to   Markov Chain Monte Carlo   algorithms for   Bayesian analysis   of problems based on probabilistic models   Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation      Modeling biological systems      main Computational systems biology    Systems biology involves the use of   computer simulation  s of   cell  biology  cellular   subsystems  such as the   metabolic network networks of metabolites   and   enzyme  s which comprise   metabolism      signal transduction   pathways and   gene regulatory network  s  to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes    Artificial life   or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple  artificial  life forms      High throughput image analysis    Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing  quantification and analysis of large amounts of high information content   biomedical imagery    Modern image analysis systems augment an observer s ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images  by improving   accuracy      Objectivity  science  objectivity    or speed  A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer  Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery  biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both   diagnostics   and research  Some examples are    high throughput and high fidelity quantification and sub cellular localization    high content screening    cytohistopathology    Bioimage informatics        morphometrics     clinical image analysis and visualization   determining the real time air flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals   quantifying occlusion size in real time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury   making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals   infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination   inferring clone overlaps in   Gene mapping DNA mapping    e g  the   Sulston score       Structural Bioinformatic Approaches        Prediction of protein structure       main Protein structure prediction    Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics  The   amino acid   sequence of a protein  the so called   primary structure    can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it  In the vast majority of cases  this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment   Of course  there are exceptions  such as the   bovine spongiform encephalopathy     aka   Mad Cow Disease       prion     Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein  For lack of better terms  structural information is usually classified as one of     secondary structure secondary          tertiary structure tertiary     and     quaternary structure quaternary     structure  A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem  As of now  most efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time   One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of   homology  biology  homology    In the genomic branch of bioinformatics  homology is used to predict the function of a gene  if the sequence of gene   A    whose function is known  is homologous to the sequence of gene   B    whose function is unknown  one could infer that B may share A s function  In the structural branch of bioinformatics  homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins  In a technique called homology modeling  this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known  This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably   One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes    leghemoglobin     Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism  Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences  their protein structures are virtually identical  which reflects their near identical purposes   Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and   de novo    from scratch  physics based modeling     See also      structural motif   and   structural domain         Molecular Interaction     Efficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins  ligands and peptides  Types of interactions most often encountered in the field include   Protein ligand  including drug   protein protein and protein peptide   Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms  termed    docking algorithms    for studying molecular interactions     See also      protein protein interaction prediction          Docking algorithms        main Protein protein docking   In the last two decades  tens of thousands of protein three dimensional structures have been determined by   X ray crystallography   and   Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy    protein NMR   One central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible protein protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes  without doing   protein protein interaction   experiments  A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the   Protein protein docking   problem  though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field     Software and tools   Software tools for bioinformatics range from simple command line tools  to more complex graphical programs and standalone web services available from various   List of bioinformatics companies bioinformatics companies   or public institutions      Web services in bioinformatics      SOAP   and   REST   based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms  data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world  The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads   Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the   European Bioinformatics Institute EBI   into three categories    Sequence alignment software SSS    Sequence Search Services     Multiple sequence alignment MSA    Multiple Sequence Alignment  and   Bioinformatics Sequence analysis BSA    Biological Sequence Analysis   The availability of these   Service orientation service oriented   bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web based bioinformatics solutions  and range from a collection

The   Small Molecule   Interaction Database is a database containing protein domain small molecule interactions  It uses a domain based approach to identify domain families  found in the Conserved Domain Database    CDD     which interact with a query small molecule  The CDD from   National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI   amalgamates data from several different sources    Protein FAMilies    PFAM     Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool    SMART     Cluster of Orthologous Genes    COGs   and NCBI s own curated sequences  The data in SMID is derived from the Protein Data Bank  PDB   a database of known protein crystal structures  SMID can be queried by entering a protein GI  domain identifier  PDB ID or SMID ID  The results of a search provide small molecule  protein  and domain information for each interaction identified in the database  Interactions with non biological contacts are normally screened out by default      SMID BLAST is a tool developed to annotate known small molecule binding sites as well as to predict binding sites in proteins whose   crystal structures   have not yet been determined  The prediction is based on extrapolation of known interactions  found in the PDB  to interactions between an uncrystallized protein with a small molecule of interest  SMID BLAST was validated against a test set of known small molecule interactions from the PDB  It was shown to be an accurate predictor of protein small molecule interactions  60  of predicted interactions identically matched the PDB annotated binding site  and of these 73   had greater than 80  of the binding residues of the protein correctly identified  Hogue  C et al  estimated that 45  of predictions that were not observed in the PDB data do in fact represent true positives   ref Snyder  K    et al     Domain based small molecule binding site annotation  BMC Bioinformatics 7  152  2006   ref     Biomolecular Interaction Network Database  BIND       Introduction    The idea of a database to document all known molecular interactions was originally put forth by   Tony Pawson   in the 1990 s and was later developed by scientists at the   University of Toronto   in collaboration with the   University of British Columbia    The development of the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database  BIND  has been supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research    CIHR     Genome Canada  the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research and Development Fund  BIND was originally designed to be a constantly growing depository for information regarding biomolecular interactions  molecular complexes and pathways  As   proteomics   is a rapidly advancing field  there is a need to have information from scientific journals readily available to researchers  BIND facilitates the understanding of molecular interactions and pathways involved in cellular processes and will eventually give scientists a better understanding of developmental processes and disease pathogenesis  The major goals of the BIND project are  to create a public proteomics resource that is available to all  to create a platform to enable   datamining   from other sources  PreBIND   to create a platform capable of presenting visualizations of complex molecular interactions  From the beginning  BIND has been   Open access  publishing  open access   and software can be freely distributed and modified  Currently  BIND includes a data specification  a database and associated data mining and visualization tools  Eventually  it is hoped that BIND will be a collection of all the interactions occurring in each of the major model organisms      Database structure    BIND contains information on three types of data  interactions  molecular complexes and pathways     Interactions are the basic component of BIND and describe how 2 or more objects  A and B  interact with each other  The objects can be a variety of things    DNA      RNA      genes      proteins      ligands    or   photons    The interaction entry contains the most amount of information about a molecule  it provides information on its name and synonyms  where it is found  e g  where in the cell  what species  when it is active  etc    and its sequence or where its sequence can be found  The interaction entry also outlines the experimental conditions required to observe binding in vitro  chemical dynamics  including   thermodynamics   and   kinetics       The second type of BIND entries are the molecular complexes  Molecular complexes are defined as an aggregate of molecules that are stable a have a function when bound to each other  The record may also contain some information on the role of the complex in various interactions and the molecular complex entry links data from 2 or more interaction records    The third component of BIND is the pathway record section  A pathway consists of a network of interactions that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes  This section may also contain information on phenotypes and diseases related to the pathway   br   The minimum amount of information needed to create an entry in BIND is a   PubMed   publication reference and an entry in another database  e g    GenBank     Each entry withiin the database provides references authors for the data  As BIND is a constantly growing database  all components of BIND track updates and changes  ref name   BIND  2001  Bader  GD    et al    BIND  The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database    Nucleic Acids Research   29  242 245  2001    ref   BIND is based on a data specification written using Abstract Syntax Notation 1    ASN 1    language  ASN 1 is used also by   National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI   when storing data for their   Entrez   system and because of this BIND uses the same standards as NCBI for data representation  The ASN 1 language is preferred because it can be easily translated into other data specification languages  e g    XML     can easily handle complex data and can be applied to all biological interactions   not just proteins   ref name   BIND  2001     Bader and Hogue

database  one must submit  contact info    PubMed   identifier and the two molecules that interact  The person who submits a record is the owner of it  All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance  BIND curation has two tracks  high throughput  HTP  and low throughput  LTP   HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology  HTP curators typically have a   bioinformatics   backgrounds  The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications  LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research  LTP curators are given further training through the   Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops    Information on   small molecule   chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject  The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published  Although  HTP studies provide more information at once  there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks  In 2004  BIND collected data from 110 journals  ref name   2005 update  Alfarano  C    et al    The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database and related tools 2005 update    Nucleic Acids Research   33  D418 D424  2005     ref      Database growth    BIND has grown significantly since its conception  in fact  the database saw a 10 fold increase in entries between 2003 and 2004  By September 2004  there were over 100 000 interaction records by 2004  including 58 266 protein protein  4 225 genetic  874 protein small molecule  25 857 protein DNA  and 19 348 biopolymer interactions   The database also contains sequence information for 31 972 proteins  4560 DNA samples and 759 RNA samples   These entries have been collected from 11 649 publications  therefore  the database represents an important amalgamation of data  The organisms with entries in the database include      Saccharomyces cerevisiae          Drosophila melanogaster          Homo sapiens          Mus musculus          Caenorhabditis elegans          Helicobacter pylori          Bos taurus        HIV 1        Gallus gallus

  Not only is the information contained within the database continually updated  the software itself has gone through several revisions  Version 1 0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction  Version 2 0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases  ref name   BIND  2001    Version 3 0  2002  expanded the database from physical biochemical interactions to

where it continues to be updated and improved        Special features    BIND was the first database of its kind to contain info on biomolecular interactions  reactions and pathways in one schema  It is also the first to base its   ontology   on chemistry which allows 3D representation of molecular interactions  The underlying chemistry allows molecular interactions to be described down to the atomic level of resolution  ref name   2005 update     PreBIND an associated system for data mining to locate biomolecular interaction information in the scientific literature  The name or   accession number   of a protein can be entered and PreBIND will scan the literature and return a list of potentially interacting proteins  BIND   BLAST   is also available to find interactions with proteins that are similar to the one specified in the query  ref name   2005 update     BIND offers several  features  that many other proteomics databases do not include  The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional   IUPAC   nomenclature to help describe   post translational modifications   that occur to amino acids  These modifications include    acetylation      formylation      methylation      palmitoylation    etc  the extension of the traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well  BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as   OntoGlyphs    The OntoGlyphs were developed based on   Gene Ontology    GO  and provide a link back to the original GO information  A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories  each one representing a specific function  binding specificity  or localization in the cell  There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total  There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information about the role of the molecule  e g  cell physiology  ion transport  signaling   There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds  e g  ligands  DNA  ions   The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell  e g  nucleus  cytoskeleton   The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results  The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results   ref name   2005 update      ProteoGlyphs   are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains  The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains  Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence      Accessing the database      Image Copy of BIND Screen JPG thumb

Biometry Biometrics  journal        Biostatistics     a contraction of biology and statistics  sometimes referred to as    biometry    or    biometrics     is the application of   statistics   to a wide range of topics in   biology    The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological experiments  especially in   medicine   and   agriculture    the collection  summarization  and analysis of data from those experiments  and the interpretation of  and inference from  the results       Biostatistics and the history of biological thought    Biostatistical reasoning and modeling were of critical importance to the foundation theories of modern biology   In the early 1900s  after the rediscovery of   Gregor Mendel Mendel s   work  the conceptual gaps in understanding between   genetics   and evolutionary   Darwinism   led to vigorous debate between biometricians such as   Walter Frank Raphael Weldon Walter Weldon   and   Karl Pearson   and Mendelians such as   Charles Benedict Davenport Charles Davenport      William Bateson   and   Wilhelm Johannsen     By the 1930s statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo Darwinian   modern evolutionary synthesis       The leading figures in the establishment of this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology      Ronald Fisher Sir Ronald A  Fisher   developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work     The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection         Sewall G  Wright   used statistics in the development of modern   population genetics       J  B  S  Haldane J  B  S Haldane s   book    The Causes of Evolution    reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics   These individuals and the work of other biostatisticians    mathematical biology mathematical biologists    and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together   evolutionary biology   and   genetics   into a consistent  coherent whole that could begin to be   Statistics quantitative  ly modeled   In parallel to this overall development  the pioneering work of   D Arcy Thompson   in   On Growth and Form   also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study   Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning  there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not   qualitative data qualitatively   apparent   One anecdote describes   Thomas Hunt Morgan   banning the   Friden  Inc  Friden calculator   from his department at   Caltech    saying  Well  I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold

all educational programmes in biostatistics are at   postgraduate   level  They are most often found in schools of public health  affiliated with schools of medicine  forestry  or agriculture or as a focus of application in departments of statistics     In the   United States    while several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments  many other top tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments  such as   epidemiology    Thus departments carrying the name  biostatistics  may exist under quite different structures  For instance  relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on   bioinformatics   and   computational biology    whereas older departments  typically affiliated with schools of   public health    will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and   clinical trial  s as well as bioinformatics  In larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist  the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration  In general  the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics one is twofold   i  statistics departments will often host theoretical methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and  ii  statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry    quality control     business and   economics   and biological areas other than

  Bounds   Although determining the bipartite dimension is computationally hard  quite a few estimates are available  For instance    harvtxt Jukna Kulikov 2009   established a relation between the size of a   maximum matching   and the bipartite dimension  More precisely  they showed that for a graph   G   with   m   edges that admits a matching of size  math  scriptstyle  nu   math  the following holds    math d G  ge  frac  nu 2  m    math     Applications   The problem of determining the bipartite dimension of a graph appears in various contexts of computing  For instance  in computer systems  different users of a system can be allowed or disallowed accessing various resources  In a   role based access control   system  a role provides access rights to a set of resources  A user can own multiple roles  and he has permission to access all resources granted by some of his roles  Also  a role can be owned by multiple users  The   role mining problem   is to find a minimum set of roles  such that for each user  his roles taken together grant access to all specified resources  The set of users together with the set of resources in the system naturally induces a bipartite graph  whose edges are permissions  Each biclique in this graph is a potential role  and the optimum solutions to the role mining problem are precisely the minimum biclique edge covers   harv Ene Horne Milosavljevic Rao 2008     A similar scenario is known in   computer security    more specifically in secure   broadcast  ing  In that setup  several messages need to be sent each to a set of receivers  over an insecure channel  Each message has to be encrypted using some cryptographic key that is known only to the intended receivers  Each receiver may possess multiple encryption keys  and each key will be distributed to multiple receivers  The   optimum key generation problem   is to find a minimum set of encryption keys for ensuring secure transmission  As above  the problem can be modeled using a bipartite graph whose minimum biclique edge covers coincide with the solutions to the optimum key generation problem   harv Shu Lee Yannakakis 2006       See also     List of NP

3942|Birational geometry|In   mathematics       birational geometry    is a part of the subject of   algebraic geometry    that deals with the geometry of an   algebraic variety   that is dependent only on its   Function field of an algebraic variety function field    In the case of dimension two  the birational geometry of algebraic surfaces was largely worked out by the   Italian school of algebraic geometry   in the years 1890 ndash 1910  From about 1970 advances have been made in higher dimensions  giving a good theory of birational geometry for dimension three   Birational geometry is largely a geometry of transformations  but it doesn t fit exactly with the   Erlangen programme    One reason is that its nature is to deal with transformations that are only defined on an open  dense subset of an algebraic variety  Such transformations  given by   rational function  s in the co ordinates  can be undefined not just at isolated points on curves  but on entire curves on a surface  and so on    A formal definition of    birational mapping    from one algebraic variety   V   to another is that it is a   rational mapping   with a rational inverse mapping  This has to be understood in the extended sense that the composition  in either order  is only in fact defined on a non empty   Zariski topology Zariski open   subset    One of the first results in the subject is the   birational isomorphism   of the   projective plane    and a non singular   quadric     Q   in projective 3 space  Already in this example one can see whole sets where the mappings are ill defined  taking a point   P   on   Q   as origin  we can use lines through   P    intersecting   Q   at one other point  to project to a plane  mdash  but this definition breaks down with all lines   tangent   to   Q   at   P    which in a certain sense  blow up    P   into the intersection of the tangent plane with the plane to which we project   That is  quite generally  we can expect birational   mappings   to act like   relation  mathematics  relation  s  with graphs containing parts that are not functional  On an open dense set they do behave like functions  but the   Zariski closure  s of their graphs are more complex correspondences on the product showing  blowing up  and  blowing down   Quite detailed descriptions of those  in terms of projective spaces associated to tangent spaces can be given and justified by the theory   An example is the   Cremona group   of birational   automorphism  s of the projective plane  In purely algebraic terms  for a given   field  mathematics  field     K    this is the automorphism group over   K   of the field   K     X      Y    of rational functions in two variables  Its structure has been analysed since the nineteenth century  but it is  large   while the corresponding group for the projective line consists only of   M bius transformation  s determined by three parameters   It is still the subject of research     See also      Birational invariant      Blowing up      Algebraic curve     References    Iitaka  Shigeru 1981    Algebraic Geometry  An Introduction to Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties  Springer Verlag  ISBN 0 387 90546 4  Koll r  J nos  Mori  Shigefumi  1998   Birational geometry of algebraic varieties  Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics  134  Cambridge University Press  MR1658959  ISBN 978 0 521 63277 5   DEFAULTSORT Birational Geometry     Category Geometry     Category Birational geometry        ar                          pt Geometria birracional     zh
